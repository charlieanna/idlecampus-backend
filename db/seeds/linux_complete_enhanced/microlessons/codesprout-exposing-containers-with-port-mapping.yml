content_md: "# CodeSprout: Exposing Containers with Port Mapping \U0001F680\n\n**Port\
  \ Mapping Challenge** \U0001F310\n\n    Your team lead Sarah has a problem:\n\n\
  \    > \"We deployed our marketing site in a container, but no one can access it!\
  \ The container is running\n    > but when we try to visit the site, nothing loads.\
  \ Can you figure out why?\"\n\n    ### The Problem\n    Containers are **isolated\
  \ by default**. Even if nginx is running perfectly inside the container on port\
  \ 80,\n    your browser on your host machine can't reach it. You need to **map**\
  \ (publish) the container's port to your host.\n\n    ### Port Mapping Explained\n\
  \    Port mapping connects a port on your **host machine** to a port inside the\
  \ **container**:\n\n    ```bash\n    docker run -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT image\n\
  \    ```\n\n    - **HOST_PORT** (e.g., `8080`) → Port on your computer\n    - **CONTAINER_PORT**\
  \ (e.g., `80`) → Port inside the container where the app listens\n    - **Format**:\
  \ `-p 8080:80` means \"send traffic from host port 8080 to container port 80\"\n\
  \n    ### Visual Example\n    ```\n    Your Browser → http://localhost:8080 → Docker\
  \ NAT → Container Port 80 → nginx\n    ```\n\n    ### The Solution\n    To make\
  \ the CodeSprout site accessible, we need to:\n    1. Map host port `8080` to container\
  \ port `80` (where nginx listens)\n    2. Run in detached mode (`-d`) so the terminal\
  \ isn't blocked\n    3. Name it `codesprout-web` for easy reference\n\n    ```bash\n\
  \    docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name codesprout-web nginx:alpine\n    ```\n\n  \
  \  After this, anyone can visit `http://localhost:8080` and see the site!\n\n  \
  \  ### Common Mistakes\n    - **Swapping ports**: `-p 80:8080` would try to map\
  \ your host's port 80 to container 8080 (wrong direction!)\n    - **Forgetting `-p`**:\
  \ Container runs but can't be accessed from outside\n    - **Port conflicts**: If\
  \ port 8080 is already in use, Docker will error - try a different port like 8081\n\
  \n## Syntax/Command\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 8080:80 --name codesprout-web nginx:alpine\n\
  ```\n\n## Example\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d --name codesprout-web -p 8080:80 nginx:alpine\n\
  ```\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Port mapping format: -p HOST:CONTAINER → -p 8080:80\n\n\
  - Remember: first number (8080) is your host, second (80) is the container\n\n-\
  \ Use -d to run in background and free your terminal"

  question: In "docker run -p 8080:80 nginx", what does 8080 represent?
  options:
  - The port on the host machine
  - The port inside the container
  - The container ID
  - The process ID
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: In -p HOST:CONTAINER format, the first port (8080) is on the host machine,
    and the second (80) is inside the container

  question: What happens if you forget the -p flag when running a web server container?
  options:
  - The container runs but cannot be accessed from outside
  - The container fails to start
  - The container automatically maps to port 80
  - The container runs on a random port
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: Without port mapping, containers are isolated and cannot be accessed
    from the host machine, even if the service is running inside
  require_pass: true
objectives:
- Understand Docker port mapping with -p flag
- Map host ports to container ports
- Expose containerized services to external access
