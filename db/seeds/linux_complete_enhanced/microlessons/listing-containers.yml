  \ \U0001F50D\n\n    Your team lead asks:\n\n    > \"We've been running containers\
  \ all week. Can you show me which ones are still running?\n    > And also, where\
  \ did that MySQL container we started yesterday go?\"\n\n    ### The Problem\n \
  \   Unlike traditional processes where you can use `ps aux` to see everything, Docker\
  \ containers\n    need their own command to list what's running. And by default,\
  \ you only see **active** containers.\n\n    ### docker ps Explained\n    The `docker\
  \ ps` command shows you information about containers:\n\n    ```bash\n    docker\
  \ ps         # Show only running containers\n    docker ps -a      # Show ALL containers\
  \ (running + stopped)\n    ```\n\n    **What you see:**\n    - Container ID (short\
  \ hash)\n    - Image name\n    - Command being run\n    - Creation time\n    - Current\
  \ status (Up/Exited)\n    - Port mappings\n    - Container name\n\n    ### Why This\
  \ Matters\n\n    **1. Quick status check:**\n    ```bash\n    $ docker ps\n    CONTAINER\
  \ ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  STATUS         PORTS            \
  \      NAMES\n    abc123def456   nginx:alpine   \"nginx -g 'daemon of...\"   Up\
  \ 2 hours   0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   codesprout-web\n    ```\n\n    **2. Find stopped\
  \ containers:**\n    ```bash\n    $ docker ps -a\n    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     \
  \     STATUS                    NAMES\n    abc123def456   nginx:alpine   Up 2 hours\
  \                codesprout-web\n    def456abc789   mysql:8.0      Exited (0) 10\
  \ hours ago   my-database\n    ```\n\n    **3. Get container IDs for automation:**\n\
  \    ```bash\n    docker ps -q        # Show only container IDs (running)\n    docker\
  \ ps -aq       # Show all container IDs (running + stopped)\n    ```\n\n    ###\
  \ Common Use Cases\n\n    **Check if a container is running:**\n    ```bash\n  \
  \  docker ps | grep codesprout-web\n    ```\n\n    **Count running containers:**\n\
  \    ```bash\n    docker ps -q | wc -l\n    ```\n\n    **Find containers to clean\
  \ up:**\n    ```bash\n    docker ps -a --filter \"status=exited\"\n    ```\n\n \
  \   **See the last created container:**\n    ```bash\n    docker ps -l       # Last\
  \ created (running or not)\n    ```\n\n    ### Visual Breakdown\n\n    ```\n   \
  \ docker ps        → Shows ONLY running containers\n                       ├─ codesprout-web\
  \ (nginx) - Up 2 hours\n                       └─ redis-cache (redis) - Up 1 hour\n\
  \n    docker ps -a     → Shows ALL containers\n                       ├─ codesprout-web\
  \ (nginx) - Up 2 hours\n                       ├─ redis-cache (redis) - Up 1 hour\n\
  \                       ├─ old-mysql (mysql) - Exited (0) 3 days ago\n         \
  \              └─ test-app (node) - Exited (1) 1 week ago\n    ```\n\n    ### Common\
  \ Mistakes\n    - **Forgetting -a**: If you don't see a container, it might be stopped.\
  \ Use `docker ps -a`.\n    - **Confusing IMAGE with CONTAINER**: Images are templates,\
  \ containers are running instances.\n    - **Not using filters**: In production\
  \ with hundreds of containers, use `--filter` to narrow results.\n\n    ### Pro\
  \ Tips\n\n    **Custom formatting:**\n    ```bash\n    docker ps --format \"table\
  \ {{.Names}}\\t{{.Status}}\\t{{.Ports}}\"\n    ```\n\n    **Filter by name:**\n\
  \    ```bash\n    docker ps -a --filter \"name=codesprout\"\n    ```\n\n    **Show\
  \ container sizes:**\n    ```bash\n    docker ps -s        # Add SIZE column\n \
  \   ```\n\n## Syntax/Command\n\n```bash\ndocker ps\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```bash\n\
  # Show running containers\ndocker ps\n\n# Show all containers (including stopped)\n\
  docker ps -a\n\n# Show only container IDs\ndocker ps -q\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n\
  - Use docker ps to see running containers\n\n- Add -a flag to include stopped containers\n\
  \n- Use -q to get only container IDs for scripting"

  hints:
  - Try docker ps -a to include stopped containers too
  - Use docker ps -q to see just the container IDs

  question: Which command lists all containers including stopped ones?
  options:
  - docker ps -a
  - docker list --all
  - docker containers
  - docker ps --running
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: The -a (or --all) flag shows all containers, not just running ones.
    docker ps alone only shows running containers
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 3
  question: What does 'docker ps -q' do?
  options:
  - Shows only container IDs in quiet mode
  - Shows containers sorted by query
  - Shows containers in queue
  - Shows quick container stats
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: The -q flag (quiet mode) outputs only container IDs, useful for scripting
    and piping to other commands
  require_pass: true
objectives:
- List running containers with docker ps
- View all containers including stopped ones with -a flag
- Use docker ps for monitoring and troubleshooting
