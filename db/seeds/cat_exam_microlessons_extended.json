Simple Average [Easy]\nThe average of 5 numbers is 24. If one number is excluded, average becomes 23. Find excluded number.\n\n**Solution:**\nSum of 5 numbers = 5 × 24 = 120\nSum of 4 numbers = 4 × 23 = 92\nExcluded number = 120 - 92 = 28\n\n### 2. Weighted Average [Medium]\nIn a class of 30 boys and 20 girls, boys' average score is 65 and girls' is 75. Find class average.\n\n**Solution:**\nWeighted Average = (30×65 + 20×75) / 50\n= (1950 + 1500) / 50 = 69\n\n### 3. Alligation [Medium]\nIn what ratio should water be mixed with wine costing Rs. 60/liter to get mixture worth Rs. 40/liter?\n\n**Solution:**\nWater costs Rs. 0, Wine costs Rs. 60, Mean is Rs. 40\nRatio = (60-40) : (40-0) = 20 : 40 = 1 : 2\nWater : Wine = 1 : 2\n\n### 4. Successive Replacement [Hard]\nA vessel contains 60L milk. 12L is removed and replaced with water. This is done 3 times. Find milk remaining.\n\n**Solution:**\nMilk remaining = 60 × (1 - 12/60)³\n= 60 × (0.8)³ = 60 × 0.512 = 30.72L\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Alligation is powerful for mixture proportion problems\n- Weighted average accounts for relative importance\n- Successive replacement follows exponential decay\n- Average lies between extreme values\n",

(NOT run)\n\n2. **Plural subject → Plural verb**\n   - The cats run. (NOT runs)\n\n3. **Compound subjects with 'and' → Plural**\n   - Tom and Jerry are friends.\n\n### Tricky Cases\n\n1. **Either/Or, Neither/Nor**\n   - Verb agrees with nearest subject\n   - Neither the teacher nor the students were happy.\n   - Neither the students nor the teacher was happy.\n\n2. **Collective Nouns**\n   - Usually singular: The team is winning.\n   - Plural if emphasizing individuals: The team are arguing among themselves.\n\n3. **Indefinite Pronouns**\n   - Singular: Everyone, someone, nobody, each, either, neither\n   - Plural: Both, few, many, several\n   - Context-dependent: All, some, none, any\n\n4. **Words between subject and verb**\n   - Don't get distracted!\n   - The box of apples is heavy.

(Everyone is singular)\n- Right: Everyone should bring his or her book. OR All students should bring their books.\n\n### Ambiguous Reference\n- Wrong: John told Peter that he was late. (Who was late?)\n- Right: John told Peter, \"I am late.\" OR John told Peter that Peter was late.\n\n### Case Errors\n- Subject case: I, he, she, we, they\n- Object case: me, him, her, us, them\n- Wrong: Him and me went to store.\n- Right: He and I went to the store.\n\n---\n\n## Parallelism\n\n### Rule\nItems in a series should have the same grammatical form.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Wrong: She likes swimming, to run, and biking.\n- Right: She likes swimming, running, and biking.\n\n- Wrong: The job requires experience, creativity, and being punctual.\n- Right: The job requires experience, creativity, and punctuality.\n\n---\n\n## Modifier Placement\n\n### Dangling Modifiers\n- Wrong: Walking to school, the rain started.\n  (Rain wasn't walking!)\n- Right: Walking to school, I got caught in the rain.\n\n### Misplaced Modifiers\n- Wrong: She almost ate the whole cake.\n  (She almost ate, but didn't?)\n- Right: She ate almost the whole cake.\n\n---\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n### 1. Subject-Verb Agreement [Easy]\nIdentify the error: \"The list of items are on the table.\"\n\n**Answer:** \"are\" should be \"is\" (subject is \"list,\" which is singular)\n\n### 2. Pronoun Reference [Medium]\nCorrect: \"When the company announced their decision, it surprised everyone.\"\n\n**Answer:** \"their\" should be \"its\" (company is singular in American English)\n\n### 3. Parallelism [Medium]\nCorrect: \"The manager is responsible for hiring, training, and to motivate employees.\"\n\n**Answer:** \"to motivate\" should be \"motivating\"\n\n### 4. Tense Consistency [Medium]\nCorrect: \"Yesterday, he goes to the market and bought vegetables.\"\n\n**Answer:** \"goes\" should be \"went\"\n\n### 5. Modifier Error [Hard]\nCorrect: \"Having finished the assignment, the TV was turned on.\"\n\n**Answer:** \"Having finished the assignment, he turned on the TV.\"\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Subject-verb agreement is fundamental\n- Pronouns must clearly refer to antecedents\n- Parallel structure maintains balance\n- Modifiers must logically connect\n- Practice identifying common error patterns\n",
