  # Array Basics

  Fundamental operations on arrays including traversal, access, and manipulation

  ---

  ## What are Arrays?

  Arrays are contiguous memory blocks that store elements of the same type. They provide O(1) random access but O(n) insertion/deletion.

  **Key Properties:**
  - Fixed or dynamic size
  - Zero-indexed access
  - Contiguous memory allocation
  - Cache-friendly due to locality

  **Time Complexities:**
  - Access: O(1)
  - Search (unsorted): O(n)
  - Insert at end: O(1) amortized
  - Insert at position: O(n)
  - Delete: O(n)

  ## Common Patterns

  ### 1. Iteration
  ```python
  for i in range(len(arr)):
      process(arr[i])
  ```

  ### 2. Reverse Iteration
  ```python
  for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
      process(arr[i])
  ```

  ### 3. In-place Modification
  ```python
  for i in range(len(arr)):
      arr[i] = transform(arr[i])
  ```

  ## When to Use This Technique

  Use arrays when you need fast random access, know the size in advance, or need cache-efficient sequential access.

  ## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

  - Index out of bounds errors
  - Not considering edge cases (empty array, single element)
  - Forgetting that arrays are zero-indexed
  - Modifying array while iterating

  ## Practice Problems

  Start with these problems to master this concept:

  ### 1. Two Sum [Easy]

  Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers that add up to target.

  **Complexity:** Time O(O(n)), Space O(O(n))

  **Hint:** Use a hash map to store numbers you've seen


  ### 2. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted [Easy]

  Given a sorted array, find two numbers that add up to a specific target.

  **Complexity:** Time O(O(n)), Space O(O(1))

  **Hint:** Use two pointers from both ends


  ### 3. Two Sum - Data Structure Design [Easy]

  Design a data structure that supports add and find operations for two sum.

  **Complexity:** Time O(O(1) add, O(n) find), Space O(O(n))


  ### 4. Two Sum Less Than K [Easy]

  Find the maximum sum of two numbers less than K.

  **Complexity:** Time O(O(n log n)), Space O(O(1))


  ### 5. Two Sum BST [Easy]

  Find if there exist two elements in a BST that sum to target.

  **Complexity:** Time O(O(n)), Space O(O(n))
