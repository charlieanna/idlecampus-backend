  # Breadth First Search (BFS)

  Graph traversal that explores all neighbors before going deeper

  ---

  ## BFS Algorithm

  BFS explores graph level by level, visiting all neighbors before moving to next level.

  **Characteristics:**
  - Uses queue
  - Finds shortest path in unweighted graphs
  - Explores breadth before depth

  **Applications:**
  - Shortest path (unweighted)
  - Level-order traversal
  - Finding nearest nodes
  - Web crawling

  **Complexity:**
  - Time: O(V + E)
  - Space: O(V) for queue

  ## Common Patterns

  ### Pattern 1: Basic BFS
  ```python
  from collections import deque

  def bfs(graph, start):
      visited = {start}
      queue = deque([start])

      while queue:
          node = queue.popleft()
          process(node)

          for neighbor in graph[node]:
              if neighbor not in visited:
                  visited.add(neighbor)
                  queue.append(neighbor)
  ```

  ### Pattern 2: BFS with Distance Tracking
  ```python
  def bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, target):
      visited = {start}
      queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (node, distance)

      while queue:
          node, dist = queue.popleft()

          if node == target:
              return dist

          for neighbor in graph[node]:
              if neighbor not in visited:
                  visited.add(neighbor)
                  queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))

      return -1  # Target not reachable
  ```

  ## When to Use This Technique

  Use BFS for shortest path in unweighted graphs, level-order traversal, finding connected components at same distance, or minimum steps problems.

  ---

  ## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

  - Using BFS for weighted graphs (use Dijkstra)
  - Not using queue (using stack makes it DFS)
  - Marking visited too late (duplicates in queue)
  - Not handling disconnected graphs
