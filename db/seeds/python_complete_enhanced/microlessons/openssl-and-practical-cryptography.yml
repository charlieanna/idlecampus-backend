  \ Cryptography\n\n    OpenSSL is a powerful toolkit for cryptographic operations.\n\
  \n    ## Generating Keys\n\n    ### RSA Key Pair\n    ```bash\n    # Generate private\
  \ key (2048-bit)\n    openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048\n\n    # Extract public\
  \ key\n    openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key\n\n    # Generate\
  \ 4096-bit key (more secure)\n    openssl genrsa -out private-4096.key 4096\n  \
  \  ```\n\n    ### Ed25519 Key Pair (Modern, Faster)\n    ```bash\n    # Generate\
  \ Ed25519 private key\n    openssl genpkey -algorithm Ed25519 -out ed25519-private.key\n\
  \n    # Extract public key\n    openssl pkey -in ed25519-private.key -pubout -out\
  \ ed25519-public.key\n    ```\n\n    ## File Encryption\n\n    ### Symmetric Encryption\
  \ (AES)\n    ```bash\n    # Encrypt file with password\n    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc\
  \ -salt -pbkdf2 -in secret.txt -out secret.enc\n\n    # Decrypt file\n    openssl\
  \ enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -in secret.enc -out secret.txt\n    ```\n\n    ###\
  \ Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)\n    ```bash\n    # Encrypt with public key\n    openssl\
  \ rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey public.key -in message.txt -out message.enc\n\n\
  \    # Decrypt with private key\n    openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private.key\
  \ -in message.enc -out message.txt\n    ```\n\n    ## Digital Signatures\n\n   \
  \ Prove authenticity and integrity of data.\n\n    ```bash\n    # Sign file with\
  \ private key\n    openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private.key -out file.sig file.txt\n\
  \n    # Verify signature with public key\n    openssl dgst -sha256 -verify public.key\
  \ -signature file.sig file.txt\n    ```\n\n    ## Hashing\n\n    ```bash\n    #\
  \ SHA-256 hash\n    sha256sum file.txt\n\n    # Multiple algorithms\n    openssl\
  \ dgst -sha256 file.txt\n    openssl dgst -sha512 file.txt\n\n    # Hash password\
  \ (for demonstration only)\n    echo -n \"mypassword\" | sha256sum\n    ```\n\n\
  \    ## Base64 Encoding\n\n    Not encryption, but useful for encoding binary data.\n\
  \n    ```bash\n    # Encode to base64\n    base64 file.bin > file.b64\n\n    # Decode\
  \ from base64\n    base64 -d file.b64 > file.bin\n\n    # Inline encoding\n    echo\
  \ \"Hello World\" | base64\n    echo \"SGVsbG8gV29ybGQK\" | base64 -d\n    ```\n\
  \n    ## Random Data Generation\n\n    ```bash\n    # Generate random bytes\n  \
  \  openssl rand -hex 32\n\n    # Generate random password\n    openssl rand -base64\
  \ 24\n\n    # Generate random file\n    openssl rand 1024 > random.dat\n    ```\n\
  \n    ## Best Practices\n\n    1. **Use Strong Algorithms**: AES-256, RSA-2048+,\
  \ SHA-256+\n    2. **Protect Private Keys**: Never share, use proper permissions\
  \ (600)\n    3. **Use Salt**: Always salt passwords\n    4. **Key Rotation**: Rotate\
  \ keys periodically\n    5. **Secure Random**: Use cryptographically secure random\

  question: What is the key difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
  options:
  - Symmetric uses one shared key; asymmetric uses a public/private key pair
  - Symmetric is always faster than asymmetric
  - Asymmetric encryption is less secure
  - They are the same thing with different names
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: Symmetric encryption (like AES) uses a single shared key for both encryption
    and decryption. Asymmetric encryption (like RSA) uses a public key for encryption
    and a private key for decryption. Symmetric is faster but requires secure key
    exchange; asymmetric solves key distribution but is slower.

  question: What is the purpose of a digital signature created with a private key?
  options:
  - To prove authenticity and integrity - that the message came from the key owner
    and wasn't modified
  - To encrypt the message so only the recipient can read it
  - To compress the message for faster transmission
  - To generate a random password
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: A digital signature is created by signing data with a private key.
    Anyone with the corresponding public key can verify the signature, proving both
    that the data came from the private key owner (authenticity) and that it hasn't
    been tampered with (integrity). This is different from encryption, which protects
    confidentiality.

  question: Why should you use cryptographically secure random number generators (like
    openssl rand) instead of standard random functions?
  options:
  - Standard random functions are predictable and unsuitable for security purposes
    like generating keys or tokens
  - openssl rand is faster
  - Standard random functions only work with small numbers
  - There is no difference between them
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: Standard random number generators (like Python's random module) are
    pseudo-random and predictable if you know the seed. For security-critical operations
    (generating keys, salts, tokens), you need cryptographically secure random generators
    (like openssl rand or Python's secrets module) that are unpredictable even to
    attackers.

    - Traceback
    - SyntaxError
  hints:
  - If `python` is not available, try `python3`.
  - The secrets and hashlib modules are part of Python's standard library.
