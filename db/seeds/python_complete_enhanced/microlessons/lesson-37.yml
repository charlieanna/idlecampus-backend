  \  ## Introduction\n    Arrays and hash tables are the foundation of most coding\
  \ interview problems. Understanding their properties and trade-offs is crucial for\
  \ interview success.\n\n    ## Arrays\n\n    ### Time Complexity\n    - **Access**:\
  \ O(1) - Direct index access\n    - **Search**: O(n) - Linear search\n    - **Insertion**:\
  \ O(n) - Requires shifting elements\n    - **Deletion**: O(n) - Requires shifting\
  \ elements\n\n    ### Common Patterns\n\n    #### 1. Two-Pointer Technique\n   \
  \ ```python\n    def two_sum_sorted(nums, target):\n        left, right = 0, len(nums)\
  \ - 1\n        while left < right:\n            current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]\n\
  \            if current_sum == target:\n                return [left, right]\n \
  \           elif current_sum < target:\n                left += 1\n            else:\n\
  \                right -= 1\n        return []\n    ```\n\n    #### 2. Sliding Window\n\
  \    ```python\n    def max_sum_subarray(nums, k):\n        window_sum = sum(nums[:k])\n\
  \        max_sum = window_sum\n\n        for i in range(k, len(nums)):\n       \
  \     window_sum = window_sum - nums[i-k] + nums[i]\n            max_sum = max(max_sum,\
  \ window_sum)\n\n        return max_sum\n    ```\n\n    ## Hash Tables\n\n    ###\
  \ Time Complexity\n    - **Access**: N/A - No ordering\n    - **Search**: O(1) average,\
  \ O(n) worst\n    - **Insertion**: O(1) average, O(n) worst\n    - **Deletion**:\
  \ O(1) average, O(n) worst\n\n    ### When to Use Hash Tables\n    1. **Counting\
  \ frequencies**: Count occurrences of elements\n    2. **Finding pairs**: Two Sum,\
  \ Three Sum problems\n    3. **Detecting duplicates**: Check if element exists\n\
  \    4. **Grouping data**: Group anagrams, categorize items\n\n    ### Example:\
  \ Two Sum Problem\n    ```python\n    def two_sum(nums, target):\n        seen =\
  \ {}\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n            complement = target -\
  \ num\n            if complement in seen:\n                return [seen[complement],\
  \ i]\n            seen[num] = i\n        return []\n    ```\n\n    ## Key Insights\n\
  \n    1. **Trade Space for Time**: Hash tables often trade memory for speed\n  \
  \  2. **Sorted Arrays**: Enable binary search and two-pointer techniques\n    3.\
  \ **In-place Operations**: Minimize space complexity when possible\n    4. **Edge\
  \ Cases**: Empty arrays, single element, duplicates\n\n    ## Practice Tips\n  \
  \  - Start with brute force, then optimize\n    - Consider sorting as a preprocessing\
  \ step\n    - Think about what information to store in hash tables\n    - Always\
  \ verify constraints (array size, value ranges)"

  question: What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
  options:
  - Lists are mutable (can be modified), tuples are immutable (cannot be changed)
  - Lists are faster than tuples
  - Tuples can only store strings
  - Lists use less memory
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: Lists are mutable - you can add, remove, or modify elements after creation using methods like append(), remove(), etc. Tuples are immutable - once created, they cannot be modified. Tuples are slightly faster and use less memory, making them ideal for fixed collections of data.

  question: What is a list comprehension in Python?
  options:
  - A concise way to create lists using a single line of code with optional filtering
  - A method to compress lists
  - A way to compare two lists
  - A list sorting algorithm
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: List comprehensions provide a concise syntax to create lists: [expression for item in iterable if condition]. For example, [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0] creates a list of squares of even numbers. This is more readable and often faster than traditional loops.

  question: What does the try-except block do in Python?
  options:
  - Handles exceptions (errors) gracefully without crashing the program
  - Tries to optimize code performance
  - Tests if code syntax is correct
  - Executes code multiple times until it succeeds
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: try-except blocks catch and handle exceptions, preventing program crashes. Code in the try block is executed, and if an exception occurs, the except block handles it. For example, catching ValueError when converting user input to int prevents crashes from invalid input.
