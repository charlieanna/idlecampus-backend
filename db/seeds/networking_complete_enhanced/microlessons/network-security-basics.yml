  # Network Security Basics

  Protecting networks from unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches.

  ## Common Network Attacks

  ### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
  Attacker intercepts communication between two parties.

  ```
  You <---> Attacker <---> Server
            (reads/modifies traffic)
  ```

  **Prevention**: Use HTTPS, verify certificates, use VPN

  ### DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
  Overwhelm a server with traffic from many sources.

  **Prevention**: Rate limiting, CDN, DDoS protection services

  ### Port Scanning
  Attacker probes for open ports and services.

  ```bash
  # Attacker runs:
  nmap -sV target.com

  # Shows open ports and services
  ```

  **Prevention**: Close unused ports, firewall, intrusion detection

  ### ARP Spoofing
  Attacker links their MAC to another IP (gateway).

  **Prevention**: Static ARP entries, ARP inspection, use VPN

  ### DNS Spoofing
  Redirect domain to malicious IP.

  **Prevention**: DNSSEC, use trusted DNS (1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8)

  ## Defense Layers

  ```
  1. Perimeter: Firewall, IDS/IPS
  2. Network: Segmentation, VLANs
  3. Host: Antivirus, host firewall
  4. Application: WAF, input validation
  5. Data: Encryption, access control
  ```

  ## Network Segmentation

  Divide network into isolated segments:

  ```
  Internet
      |
  [Firewall]
      |
  +---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |
  DMZ Prod Dev Management

  DMZ: Web servers (public facing)
  Prod: Application/database servers
  Dev: Development environment
  Management: Admin access only
  ```

  ## Security Tools

  ### Intrusion Detection (IDS)
  Monitors and alerts on suspicious activity:
  - **Snort**: Open source IDS
  - **Suricata**: High-performance IDS

  ### Vulnerability Scanning
  ```bash
  # Scan for open ports
  nmap -sV -sC target.com

  # Web vulnerability scanner
  nikto -h http://target.com

  # SSL/TLS testing
  testssl.sh https://target.com
  ```

  ### Packet Capture
  ```bash
  # Capture traffic on interface
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0

  # Capture specific port
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 80

  # Save to file
  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap

  # Analyze with Wireshark
  wireshark capture.pcap
  ```

  ## Security Best Practices

  ### Network Level
  - Use firewalls with default deny
  - Segment networks (VLANs)
  - Encrypt traffic (TLS, VPN)
  - Monitor with IDS/IPS
  - Regular security audits

  ### Access Control
  - Strong authentication
  - Principle of least privilege
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  - Regular access reviews

  ### Encryption
  - HTTPS everywhere
  - VPN for remote access
  - Encrypt data at rest
  - Use modern protocols (TLS 1.3)

  ### Monitoring
  - Log all network activity
  - Set up alerts for anomalies
  - Regular log review
  - Incident response plan

  ## Quick Security Checklist

  ```
  [ ] Firewall enabled with default deny
  [ ] Unused ports closed
  [ ] Services updated/patched
  [ ] Strong passwords/keys
  [ ] MFA enabled where possible
  [ ] Traffic encrypted (HTTPS/TLS)
  [ ] Network segmented
  [ ] Logs monitored
  [ ] Backups in place
  [ ] Incident response plan
  ```

exercises:
  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 1
    question: What is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack?
    options:
      - Overloading a server with traffic
      - Intercepting communication between two parties
      - Scanning for open ports
      - Guessing passwords
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: MITM attacks intercept communications, allowing attackers to read or modify data. Use HTTPS and verify certificates to prevent this.

    sequence_order: 2
    question: What is the purpose of network segmentation?
    options:
      - Speed up the network
      - Isolate different parts of the network for security
      - Reduce hardware costs
      - Simplify configuration
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Network segmentation isolates systems so a breach in one segment doesn't compromise others. Critical systems should be in separate segments.

    sequence_order: 3
    question: What does an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) do?
    options:
      - Blocks all network traffic
      - Monitors and alerts on suspicious activity
      - Encrypts network traffic
      - Assigns IP addresses
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: An IDS monitors network traffic and alerts administrators when it detects suspicious patterns. An IPS can also block threats.

    question: Which command captures network packets on Linux?
    options:
      - netstat
      - tcpdump
      - ping
      - traceroute
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: tcpdump captures packets on a network interface. Wireshark provides a graphical interface for packet analysis.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 5
    question: What is the principle of least privilege?
    options:
      - Give users admin access for convenience
      - Give users only the minimum access needed for their job
      - Remove all access by default
      - Share passwords among team members
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Least privilege means users and systems should only have the minimum access needed. This limits damage if an account is compromised.

objectives:
  - Understand common network attacks and prevention
  - Apply defense-in-depth security principles
  - Use basic security tools for monitoring
