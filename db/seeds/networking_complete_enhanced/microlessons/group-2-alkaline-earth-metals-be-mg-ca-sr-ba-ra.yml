  \n\n# Group 2 - Alkaline Earth Metals\n\n    ## Introduction\n\n    Group 2 elements\
  \ are called **alkaline earth metals** because their oxides and hydroxides are alkaline\
  \ and are found in earth's crust.\n\n    **Members:** Beryllium (Be), Magnesium\
  \ (Mg), Calcium (Ca), Strontium (Sr), Barium (Ba), Radium (Ra)\n\n    ## Electronic\
  \ Configuration\n\n    All alkaline earth metals have **two valence electrons**\
  \ in their outermost s-orbital.\n\n    - Be: [He] 2s²\n    - Mg: [Ne] 3s²\n    -\
  \ Ca: [Ar] 4s²\n    - Sr: [Kr] 5s²\n    - Ba: [Xe] 6s²\n    - Ra: [Rn] 7s²\n\n \
  \   Common oxidation state: **+2**\n\n    ## Physical Properties\n\n    ### Atomic\
  \ and Ionic Radii\n    - **Increase down the group:** Be < Mg < Ca < Sr < Ba < Ra\n\
  \    - Smaller than corresponding alkali metals (same period)\n    - Reason: Higher\
  \ nuclear charge with same number of shells\n\n    ### Ionization Energy\n    -\
  \ **Decreases down the group:** Be > Mg > Ca > Sr > Ba > Ra\n    - Higher than alkali\
  \ metals (need to remove 2 electrons)\n    - Still relatively low → readily form\
  \ M²⁺ ions\n\n    ### Electronegativity\n    - **Decreases down the group:** Be\
  \ > Mg > Ca > Sr > Ba > Ra\n    - Lower than alkali metals in same period\n\n  \
  \  ### Density\n    - **Increases down the group:** Be < Mg < Ca < Sr < Ba < Ra\n\
  \    - Higher than alkali metals\n\n    ### Melting and Boiling Points\n    - **Decrease\
  \ down the group** (except Mg < Ca)\n    - Higher than alkali metals (stronger metallic\
  \ bonding)\n\n    ### Hardness\n    - **Harder than alkali metals**\n    - Beryllium\
  \ is the hardest\n    - Decreases down the group\n\n    ### Physical Appearance\n\
  \    - Silvery-white metals\n    - Less reactive than alkali metals (but still reactive)\n\
  \n    ## Chemical Properties\n\n    ### 1. Reaction with Oxygen\n\n    Form ionic\
  \ oxides (MO):\n\n    2M + O₂ → 2MO\n\n    - BeO: Amphoteric (reacts with both acids\
  \ and bases)\n    - Other oxides: Basic\n    - **Basicity increases down the group:**\
  \ BeO < MgO < CaO < SrO < BaO\n\n    ### 2. Reaction with Water\n\n    **Beryllium:**\
  \ Does not react with water (protective oxide layer)\n\n    **Magnesium:** Reacts\
  \ slowly with cold water, rapidly with hot water:\n    Mg + 2H₂O → Mg(OH)₂ + H₂\n\
  \n    **Ca, Sr, Ba:** React readily with cold water:\n    M + 2H₂O → M(OH)₂ + H₂\n\
  \n    **Reactivity:** Be < Mg < Ca < Sr < Ba\n\n    ### 3. Reaction with Acids\n\
  \n    React with dilute acids to give hydrogen gas:\n\n    M + 2HCl → MCl₂ + H₂↑\n\
  \n    ### 4. Reaction with Halogens\n\n    Form ionic halides (MX₂):\n\n    M +\
  \ X₂ → MX₂\n\n    - BeCl₂ has covalent character (polymeric structure)\n    - Other\
  \ halides are predominantly ionic\n\n    ### 5. Reaction with Hydrogen\n\n    Form\
  \ hydrides (MH₂) at high temperature:\n\n    M + H₂ → MH₂\n\n    - BeH₂ is covalent\
  \ (polymeric)\n    - Others are ionic\n\n    ### 6. Reducing Nature\n\n    Alkaline\
  \ earth metals are **reducing agents** (but weaker than alkali metals).\n\n    **Reducing\
  \ power:** Ba > Sr > Ca > Mg > Be\n\n    ## Solubility of Salts\n\n    ### Hydroxides:\
  \ M(OH)₂\n    **Solubility and basicity increase down the group:**\n    Be(OH)₂\
  \ < Mg(OH)₂ < Ca(OH)₂ < Sr(OH)₂ < Ba(OH)₂\n\n    - Be(OH)₂: Amphoteric, sparingly\
  \ soluble\n    - Mg(OH)₂: Sparingly soluble, weak base\n    - Ca(OH)₂: Moderately\
  \ soluble (lime water)\n    - Ba(OH)₂: Quite soluble, strong base\n\n    ### Sulfates:\
  \ MSO₄\n    **Solubility decreases down the group:**\n    BeSO₄ > MgSO₄ > CaSO₄\
  \ > SrSO₄ > BaSO₄\n\n    - BaSO₄: Almost insoluble (used in medical imaging)\n \
  \   - Hydration enthalpy decreases faster than lattice energy\n\n    ### Carbonates:\
  \ MCO₃\n    **Thermal stability increases down the group:**\n    BeCO₃ < MgCO₃ <\
  \ CaCO₃ < SrCO₃ < BaCO₃\n\n    All decompose on heating:\n    MCO₃ → MO + CO₂\n\n\
  \    - BeCO₃ and MgCO₃: Least stable\n    - BaCO₃: Most stable\n\n    ## Anomalous\
  \ Properties of Beryllium\n\n    Beryllium differs from other alkaline earth metals\
  \ due to **very small size** and **high ionization energy**:\n\n    1. **Hardest**\
  \ and **highest melting point**\n    2. **Does not react with water** (protective\
  \ oxide layer)\n    3. Forms **covalent compounds** (BeCl₂, BeH₂ are covalent polymers)\n\
  \    4. **BeO and Be(OH)₂ are amphoteric** (others are basic)\n    5. **Does not\
  \ form complexes easily** (except with fluoride: [BeF₄]²⁻)\n    6. **Carbonate unstable**\
  \ (BeCO₃ exists only in solution)\n    7. Forms **coordinate covalent bonds** in\
  \ many compounds\n\n    ## Diagonal Relationship: Be and Al\n\n    Beryllium shows\
  \ similarity with Aluminium:\n\n    | Property | Similarity |\n    |----------|-----------|\n\

  question: Why is the second ionization energy of alkaline earth metals higher than
    the first?
  options:
  - Removing an electron from a positively charged ion requires more energy
  - The second electron is in a lower energy level
  - The atomic radius decreases
  - The nuclear charge increases
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: The second ionization energy is always higher because after losing
    the first electron, the ion has a positive charge. Removing another electron from
    this positively charged species requires more energy due to increased effective
    nuclear charge on the remaining electrons.
