  \n\n# Basic Laboratory Techniques in Organic Chemistry\n\n    ## 1. Introduction\
  \ to Practical Organic Chemistry\n\n    ### Importance\n    - **Synthesis:** Preparing\
  \ organic compounds\n    - **Purification:** Obtaining pure products\n    - **Analysis:**\
  \ Identifying unknown compounds\n    - **Characterization:** Determining structure\
  \ and properties\n\n    ### Safety Principles\n    1. Always wear **safety goggles**\
  \ and **lab coat**\n    2. Work in a **fume hood** with volatile/toxic compounds\n\
  \    3. Know the location of **fire extinguisher** and **safety shower**\n    4.\
  \ Never taste or directly smell chemicals\n    5. Dispose of chemical waste properly\n\
  \n    ---\n\n    ## 2. Crystallization and Recrystallization\n\n    ### Principle\n\
  \    - **Solubility difference:** Most substances are more soluble in hot solvent\
  \ than cold\n    - **Impurities:** Either remain dissolved or don't dissolve at\
  \ all\n\n    ### Procedure\n    1. **Dissolve:** Impure solid in minimum hot solvent\n\
  \    2. **Filter hot:** Remove insoluble impurities\n    3. **Cool slowly:** Pure\
  \ crystals form\n    4. **Filter cold:** Collect crystals (impurities stay in solution)\n\
  \    5. **Wash:** With cold solvent\n    6. **Dry:** Remove residual solvent\n\n\
  \    ### Choice of Solvent\n    **Ideal solvent should:**\n    - Dissolve large\
  \ amount of substance when hot\n    - Dissolve very little when cold\n    - Not\
  \ react with the substance\n    - Have low boiling point (easy to remove)\n    -\
  \ Be non-toxic and non-flammable (preferred)\n\n    **Common solvents:**\n    -\
  \ Water, ethanol, methanol\n    - Acetone, diethyl ether\n    - Petroleum ether,\
  \ benzene, toluene\n\n    ### Example\n    **Purification of benzoic acid:**\n \
  \   - Soluble in hot water, insoluble in cold water\n    - Dissolve in hot water\
  \ → Cool → Crystals form\n    - Filter, wash with cold water, dry\n\n    ---\n\n\
  \    ## 3. Distillation\n\n    ### A. Simple Distillation\n\n    **Principle:**\
  \ Separation based on **boiling point difference** (>25°C)\n\n    **Setup:**\n \
  \   ```\n    Thermometer\n        |\n    [Round-bottom flask with liquid]\n    \
  \    ↓ heat\n    [Condenser with cold water]\n        ↓\n    [Receiving flask]\n\
  \    ```\n\n    **Applications:**\n    - Purifying liquids\n    - Separating liquid\
  \ from non-volatile impurities\n    - Example: Purifying ethanol from water-ethanol\
  \ mixture (not efficient for close bp)\n\n    ### B. Fractional Distillation\n\n\
  \    **Principle:** Separation of liquids with **close boiling points** (<25°C)\n\
  \n    **Setup:** Same as simple distillation but with **fractionating column** (packed\
  \ with glass beads or steel wool)\n\n    **How it works:**\n    - Multiple vaporization-condensation\
  \ cycles\n    - Lower bp component concentrates at top\n    - Higher bp component\
  \ returns to flask\n\n    **Applications:**\n    - Petroleum refining\n    - Separating\
  \ ethanol (78°C) from water (100°C)\n    - Separating benzene (80°C) from toluene\
  \ (111°C)\n\n    ### C. Steam Distillation\n\n    **Principle:** Used for **heat-sensitive,\
  \ water-immiscible** organic compounds\n\n    **Key point:**\n    - Mixture boils\
  \ when sum of vapor pressures = atmospheric pressure\n    - Boiling point < 100°C\
  \ (both components' bp)\n\n    **Setup:**\n    ```\n    [Steam generator] → [Flask\
  \ with organic compound + water] → [Condenser] → [Receiver]\n    ```\n\n    **Applications:**\n\
  \    - Extracting essential oils (aniline, nitrobenzene)\n    - Purifying natural\
  \ products\n    - Example: Isolating aniline (bp 184°C) at ~98°C\n\n    **Advantages:**\n\
  \    - Compounds distill below their boiling points\n    - Prevents decomposition\
  \ of heat-sensitive compounds\n\n    ---\n\n    ## 4. Sublimation\n\n    ### Principle\n\
  \    **Sublimation:** Direct conversion from solid → gas without passing through\
  \ liquid phase.\n\n    ### Procedure\n    1. Place crude solid in sublimation apparatus\n\
  \    2. Heat gently\n    3. Pure substance sublimes and condenses on cold surface\n\
  \    4. Impurities remain behind (if non-volatile)\n\n    ### Compounds that Sublime\n\
  \    - **Organic:** Benzoic acid, camphor, naphthalene, anthracene\n    - **Inorganic:**\
  \ Iodine, ammonium chloride, dry ice (CO₂)\n\n    ### Applications\n    - Purifying\
  \ solids that sublime readily\n    - Separating from non-volatile impurities\n\n\
  \    ---\n\n    ## 5. Chromatography\n\n    ### Principle\n    **Separation** based\
  \ on differential migration of components between:\n    - **Stationary phase:**\
  \ Fixed (solid or liquid)\n    - **Mobile phase:** Moving (liquid or gas)\n\n  \
  \  ### A. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)\n\n    **Stationary phase:** Thin layer\
  \ of silica gel or alumina on glass/plastic plate\n\n    **Mobile phase:** Liquid\
  \ solvent\n\n    **Procedure:**\n    1. Spot sample near bottom of TLC plate\n \
  \   2. Place plate in chamber with solvent (below spot level)\n    3. Solvent rises\
  \ by capillary action\n    4. Components separate based on polarity\n    5. Visualize\
  \ spots (UV light or iodine vapor)\n\n    **Rf value (Retention factor):**\n   \
  \ ```\n    Rf = Distance traveled by compound / Distance traveled by solvent\n\n\
  \    0 < Rf < 1\n    ```\n\n    **Applications:**\n    - Checking purity\n    -\
  \ Monitoring reactions\n    - Identifying compounds\n\n    **Interpretation:**\n\
  \    - More polar compound → Lower Rf (sticks to polar silica)\n    - Less polar\
  \ compound → Higher Rf (moves with solvent)\n\n    ### B. Column Chromatography\n\
  \n    **Stationary phase:** Silica gel or alumina packed in column\n\n    **Mobile\
  \ phase:** Liquid solvent (eluting solvent)\n\n    **Procedure:**\n    1. Pack column\
  \ with adsorbent (silica gel)\n    2. Load sample mixture at top\n    3. Elute with\
  \ solvent\n    4. Less polar compounds elute first\n    5. Collect fractions, analyze\n\
  \n    **Applications:**\n    - Separating mixtures\n    - Purifying compounds\n\
  \    - Large-scale separations\n\n    ---\n\n    ## 6. Extraction and Washing\n\n\
  \    ### Liquid-Liquid Extraction\n\n    **Principle:** Transfer of solute from\
  \ one solvent to another (immiscible solvents)\n\n    **Based on:** **Distribution\
  \ law** (partition coefficient)\n    ```\n    K = Concentration in solvent A / Concentration\
  \ in solvent B\n    ```\n\n    **Setup:**\n    - **Separatory funnel**\n    - Two\
  \ immiscible solvents (e.g., water and ether)\n\n    **Procedure:**\n    1. Add\
  \ mixture to separatory funnel with two solvents\n    2. Shake vigorously (vent\
  \ periodically)\n    3. Let layers separate\n    4. Drain lower layer\n    5. Collect\
  \ upper layer\n\n    **Applications:**\n    - Isolating organic products from aqueous\
  \ solutions\n    - Removing impurities\n\n    ### Acid-Base Extraction\n\n    **Principle:**\
  \ Use acid/base to convert organic compound to ionic form (water-soluble)\n\n  \
  \  **Example: Separating carboxylic acid, phenol, and neutral compound**\n\n   \
  \ ```\n    Mixture in ether\n        ↓ Extract with NaOH (base)\n    [Aqueous layer:\
  \ RCOO⁻ + phenolate]  [Ether layer: neutral compound]\n        ↓ Acidify\n    RCOOH\
  \ + Phenol (precipitate)\n\n    Further separate phenol using NaHCO₃ (weaker base)\n\
  \    - RCOOH reacts with NaHCO₃ → RCOONa (water-soluble)\n    - Phenol does NOT\
  \ react (too weak acid)\n    ```\n\n    **Key reactions:**\n    - RCOOH + NaOH →\
  \ RCOONa (soluble)\n    - ArOH + NaOH → ArONa (soluble)\n    - RCOOH + NaHCO₃ →\
  \ RCOONa + H₂O + CO₂\n\n    ---\n\n    ## 7. Drying Agents\n\n    ### Purpose\n\
  \    Remove traces of water from organic solvents or solutions\n\n    ### Common\
  \ Drying Agents\n\n    | Drying Agent | Use | Advantages | Disadvantages |\n   \
  \ |--------------|-----|------------|---------------|\n    | **Anhydrous Na₂SO₄**\
  \ | General purpose | Neutral, mild | Slow, low capacity |\n    | **Anhydrous MgSO₄**\
  \ | General purpose | Fast, high capacity | Slightly acidic |\n    | **Anhydrous\
  \ CaCl₂** | Hydrocarbons, ethers | Fast, cheap | Reacts with alcohols, amines |\n\
  \    | **Anhydrous K₂CO₃** | Esters, ketones | Basic (removes acids) | Cannot use\
  \ with acidic compounds |\n    | **Molecular sieves** | All solvents | Very efficient\
  \ | Expensive |\n\n    ### Procedure\n    1. Add drying agent to wet organic solution\n\
  \    2. Swirl/stir for 5-10 minutes\n    3. Filter off drying agent\n    4. Solvent\
  \ is now anhydrous\n\n    ---\n\n    ## 8. Determination of Melting Point\n\n  \
  \  ### Importance\n    - **Identification:** Pure compounds have sharp melting points\n\
  \    - **Purity:** Impurities lower and broaden melting point\n\n    ### Procedure\n\
  \    1. Pack powdered sample in capillary tube\n    2. Heat slowly in melting point\
  \ apparatus\n    3. Note temperature when melting starts and when complete\n\n \
  \   ### Interpretation\n    - **Sharp mp (1-2°C range):** Pure compound\n    - **Broad\
  \ mp (>5°C range):** Impure\n    - **Lower than expected:** Impurities present\n\
  \n    ### Mixed Melting Point\n    - Mix unknown with known compound\n    - If mp\
  \ doesn't change → Same compound\n    - If mp decreases/broadens → Different compounds\n\
  \n    ---\n\n    ## 9. Determination of Boiling Point\n\n    ### Importance\n  \
  \  - Identification of liquid compounds\n    - Purity check\n\n    ### Simple Method\n\
  \    1. Heat liquid in small flask with thermometer\n    2. Note temperature when\
  \ boiling (constant temperature)\n\n    ### Micro Method (Siwoloboff Method)\n \
  \   - Use capillary tube inverted in liquid\n    - When bubbles stream rapidly →\
  \ boiling point\n\n    ### Interpretation\n    - **Constant bp:** Pure liquid\n\
  \    - **Range of bp:** Mixture\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Important Points for IIT JEE\n\
  \n    1. **Crystallization:**\n       - Compound should be soluble in hot solvent,\
  \ insoluble in cold\n       - Impurities remain in solution (mother liquor)\n\n\
  \    2. **Distillation types:**\n       - Simple: bp difference >25°C\n       -\
  \ Fractional: bp difference <25°C\n       - Steam: Heat-sensitive, water-immiscible\
  \ compounds\n\n    3. **Sublimation examples:**\n       - Benzoic acid, naphthalene,\
  \ camphor, iodine\n\n    4. **TLC Rf values:**\n       - Polar compounds: Low Rf\
  \ (stick to silica)\n       - Non-polar compounds: High Rf (move with solvent)\n\
  \n    5. **Acid-base extraction:**\n       - Strong acid (RCOOH): Reacts with NaHCO₃\
  \ and NaOH\n       - Weak acid (ArOH): Reacts only with NaOH\n       - Use to separate\
  \ mixtures\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Practice Questions\n\n    1. What solvent would\
  \ you choose to recrystallize benzoic acid? Why?\n    2. Explain why steam distillation\
  \ is used for isolating aniline.\n    3. Calculate Rf if a compound travels 4.5\
  \ cm and solvent travels 6.0 cm.\n    4. How would you separate a mixture of benzoic\
  \ acid, phenol, and toluene using extraction?\n    5. What drying agent would you\
  \ use for drying ethanol? Why not CaCl₂?\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Crystallization and\

  question: Which distillation technique should be used for separating liquids with
    boiling points that differ by less than 25°C?
  options:
  - Fractional distillation
  - Simple distillation
  - Steam distillation
  - Vacuum distillation
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: Fractional distillation uses a fractionating column that provides multiple
    vaporization-condensation cycles, making it effective for separating liquids with
    close boiling points (<25°C). Simple distillation is only effective when the boiling
    point difference is greater than 25°C.
