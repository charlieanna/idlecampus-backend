  # HTTP and HTTPS Basics

  HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is how web browsers and servers communicate.

  ## HTTP Request/Response

  ### Request Structure
  ```
  GET /api/users HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  Accept: application/json
  Authorization: Bearer token123
  ```

  ### Response Structure
  ```
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json
  Content-Length: 128

  {"users": [...]}
  ```

  ## HTTP Methods

  | Method | Purpose | Idempotent |
  |--------|---------|------------|
  | GET | Retrieve data | Yes |
  | POST | Create new resource | No |
  | PUT | Replace resource | Yes |
  | PATCH | Partial update | No |
  | DELETE | Remove resource | Yes |
  | HEAD | Get headers only | Yes |
  | OPTIONS | Get allowed methods | Yes |

  ## HTTP Status Codes

  ### 2xx - Success
  - **200 OK** - Request succeeded
  - **201 Created** - Resource created
  - **204 No Content** - Success with no body

  ### 3xx - Redirection
  - **301 Moved Permanently** - URL changed
  - **302 Found** - Temporary redirect
  - **304 Not Modified** - Use cached version

  ### 4xx - Client Errors
  - **400 Bad Request** - Invalid syntax
  - **401 Unauthorized** - Authentication required
  - **403 Forbidden** - Access denied
  - **404 Not Found** - Resource doesn't exist
  - **429 Too Many Requests** - Rate limited

  ### 5xx - Server Errors
  - **500 Internal Server Error** - Server crashed
  - **502 Bad Gateway** - Invalid upstream response
  - **503 Service Unavailable** - Server overloaded
  - **504 Gateway Timeout** - Upstream timeout

  ## HTTP Headers

  ### Common Request Headers
  ```
  Host: example.com
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0...
  Accept: text/html, application/json
  Accept-Language: en-US
  Authorization: Bearer xyz
  Content-Type: application/json
  Cookie: session=abc123
  ```

  ### Common Response Headers
  ```
  Content-Type: application/json
  Content-Length: 1234
  Cache-Control: max-age=3600
  Set-Cookie: session=abc123
  Location: /new-url (for redirects)
  ```

  ## HTTP vs HTTPS

  | Feature | HTTP | HTTPS |
  |---------|------|-------|
  | Port | 80 | 443 |
  | Encryption | None | TLS/SSL |
  | Security | Not secure | Encrypted |
  | URL | http:// | https:// |

  ### Why HTTPS Matters
  - **Encryption**: Data can't be read in transit
  - **Authentication**: Verify server identity
  - **Integrity**: Detect tampering
  - **SEO**: Google ranks HTTPS higher
  - **Browser Trust**: No "Not Secure" warning

  ## Using cURL

  ```bash
  # GET request
  curl https://api.example.com/users

  # POST with JSON data
  curl -X POST https://api.example.com/users \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name": "John"}'

  # Include headers
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer token" \
    https://api.example.com/protected

  # Show response headers
  curl -I https://example.com

  # Verbose output (see full request/response)
  curl -v https://example.com

  # Follow redirects
  curl -L https://example.com

  # Save response to file
  curl -o output.html https://example.com
  ```

  ## HTTP/2 and HTTP/3

  ### HTTP/2 Improvements
  - **Multiplexing**: Multiple requests over one connection
  - **Header compression**: Smaller headers
  - **Server push**: Server sends resources proactively
  - **Binary protocol**: More efficient than text

  ### HTTP/3
  - Uses **QUIC** instead of TCP
  - Even faster connection setup
  - Better handling of packet loss

exercises:
  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 1
    question: Which HTTP status code indicates a resource was not found?
    options:
      - 200
      - 401
      - 404
      - 500
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: 404 Not Found indicates the requested resource doesn't exist on the server. 200 is success, 401 is unauthorized, 500 is server error.

    question: What HTTP method should be used to create a new resource?
    options:
      - GET
      - POST
      - PUT
      - DELETE
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: POST is used to create new resources. GET retrieves data, PUT replaces existing resources, DELETE removes them.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 3
    question: What is the main difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
    options:
      - HTTPS is faster
      - HTTPS encrypts data using TLS/SSL
      - HTTP uses port 443
      - There is no difference
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: HTTPS encrypts all data between client and server using TLS/SSL, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. HTTP sends data in plain text.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 4
    question: What does a 500 status code indicate?
    options:
      - The request was successful
      - The client made a bad request
      - The server encountered an internal error
      - The resource was moved
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: 500 Internal Server Error means something went wrong on the server side. The 5xx range always indicates server errors.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 5
    question: Which HTTP header specifies the format of the request body?
    options:
      - Accept
      - Content-Type
      - User-Agent
      - Host
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Content-Type tells the server what format the request body is in (e.g., application/json). Accept tells the server what formats the client can handle in the response.

  - type: terminal
    sequence_order: 6
    description: Fetch the HTTP headers from https://example.com using curl
    command: curl -I https://example.com
    timeout_sec: 15
    validation:
      exit_code: 0
      output_contains:
        - "HTTP/"
        - "200"
    hints:
      - Use curl with the -I flag to fetch headers only
      - This performs a HEAD request

objectives:
  - Understand HTTP request/response structure
  - Know common HTTP methods and status codes
  - Explain the security benefits of HTTPS
