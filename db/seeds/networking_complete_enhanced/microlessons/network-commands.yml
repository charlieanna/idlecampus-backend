  \ ## Testing Connectivity\n\n    ```bash\n    # Ping host\n    ping google.com\n\
  \    ping -c 4 8.8.8.8  # Send 4 packets\n\n    # Test HTTP connectivity\n    curl\
  \ https://example.com\n\n    # Show response headers\n    curl -I https://example.com\n\
  \n    # Download file\n    curl -O https://example.com/file.zip\n    wget https://example.com/file.zip\n\
  \n    # DNS lookup\n    nslookup example.com\n    dig example.com\n    host example.com\n\
  \    ```\n\n    ## Network Configuration\n\n    ```bash\n    # Show network interfaces\
  \ (modern)\n    ip addr show\n    ip a\n\n    # Show specific interface\n    ip\
  \ addr show eth0\n\n    # Show routing table\n    ip route show\n\n    # Show network\
  \ statistics\n    netstat -i\n    ```\n\n    ## Checking Ports\n\n    ```bash\n\
  \    # Show listening ports\n    netstat -tuln\n    ss -tuln  # Modern alternative\n\
  \n    # Show which process is using a port\n    sudo lsof -i :80\n    sudo netstat\
  \ -tulpn | grep :80\n\n    # Test specific port\n    telnet example.com 80\n   \
  \ nc -zv example.com 80\n    ```\n\n    ## File Transfer\n\n    ```bash\n    # Copy\
  \ file to remote server\n    scp file.txt user@server:/path/\n\n    # Copy from\
  \ remote to local\n    scp user@server:/path/file.txt .\n\n    # Copy directory\
  \ recursively\n    scp -r directory/ user@server:/path/\n\n    # Sync directories\
  \ (more efficient)\n    rsync -avz source/ user@server:/destination/\n\n    # Sync\
  \ with progress\n    rsync -avz --progress source/ dest/\n    ```\n\n    ## Common\
  \ Ports\n\n    | Port | Service |\n    |------|---------|\n    | 22 | SSH |\n  \
  \  | 80 | HTTP |\n    | 443 | HTTPS |\n    | 3306 | MySQL |\n    | 5432 | PostgreSQL\
  \ |\n    | 6379 | Redis |\n    | 27017 | MongoDB |"

  question: Which command is used to test network connectivity to a remote host?
  options:
  - ping
  - curl
  - nslookup
  - netstat
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: The ping command sends ICMP echo request packets to a remote host to test network connectivity and measure round-trip time.
- type: mcq

  question: Which command would you use to perform a DNS lookup for a domain name?
  options:
  - netstat
  - nslookup
  - ping
  - curl
  correct_answer_index: 1
  explanation: nslookup is used to query DNS servers to resolve domain names to IP addresses. dig and host are also DNS lookup tools.
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 3
  question: What does the command 'netstat -tuln' show?
  options:
  - All listening TCP and UDP ports in numeric format
  - Active network connections only
  - Routing table information
  - Network interface statistics
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: The -t flag shows TCP connections, -u shows UDP, -l shows listening ports, and -n shows numeric addresses instead of resolving hostnames.
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 4
  question: Which command downloads a file from a URL?
  options:
  - ping
  - nslookup
  - curl or wget
  - netstat
  correct_answer_index: 2
  explanation: Both curl and wget can download files from URLs. curl with -O flag or wget will download and save files.
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 5
  question: What is the purpose of the 'ss' command?
  options:
  - It's a modern alternative to netstat for displaying socket statistics
  - It's used to send emails
  - It's used to schedule tasks
  - It's used to search files
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: ss (socket statistics) is the modern replacement for netstat, providing faster and more detailed socket information.

  question: Which port does HTTPS typically use?
  options:
  - 80
  - 443
  - 22
  - 3306
  correct_answer_index: 1
  explanation: HTTPS uses port 443 by default. HTTP uses port 80, SSH uses port 22, and MySQL uses port 3306.
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 7
  question: What does 'curl -I https://example.com' do?
  options:
  - Downloads the full page content
  - Shows only the HTTP response headers
  - Sends a POST request
  - Tests DNS resolution
  correct_answer_index: 1
  explanation: The -I flag (or --head) makes curl fetch headers only, using the HEAD HTTP method. This is useful for checking server responses without downloading content.

  validation:
    exit_code: 0
    output_contains:
    - "Name:"
    - "Address:"
  hints:
  - nslookup queries DNS servers

  description: Show all listening TCP and UDP ports in numeric format
  command: netstat -tuln
  timeout_sec: 5
  validation:
    exit_code: 0
    output_contains:
    - "Proto"
    - "Local Address"
  hints:
  - Use -t for TCP, -u for UDP, -l for listening, -n for numeric
  - Modern alternative is 'ss -tuln'
