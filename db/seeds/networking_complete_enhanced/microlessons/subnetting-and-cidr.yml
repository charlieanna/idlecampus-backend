  # Subnetting and CIDR

  Subnetting divides a large network into smaller, more manageable networks.

  ## Why Subnet?

  - **Security**: Isolate sensitive systems
  - **Performance**: Reduce broadcast traffic
  - **Organization**: Separate departments/functions
  - **Efficiency**: Use IP addresses more effectively

  ## Binary Basics

  Each octet is 8 bits:

  ```
  128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1
    1   1   1   1   1   1   1   1  = 255
    1   1   0   0   0   0   0   0  = 192
    1   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  = 128
  ```

  ## CIDR Notation

  CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation shows network size:

  ```
  /24 = 255.255.255.0   = 256 IPs (254 usable)
  /25 = 255.255.255.128 = 128 IPs (126 usable)
  /26 = 255.255.255.192 = 64 IPs  (62 usable)
  /27 = 255.255.255.224 = 32 IPs  (30 usable)
  /28 = 255.255.255.240 = 16 IPs  (14 usable)
  /29 = 255.255.255.248 = 8 IPs   (6 usable)
  /30 = 255.255.255.252 = 4 IPs   (2 usable)
  /32 = 255.255.255.255 = 1 IP    (single host)
  ```

  ## Calculating Subnets

  ### Formula
  ```
  Total IPs = 2^(32 - CIDR)
  Usable IPs = Total - 2 (network + broadcast)
  ```

  ### Example: /26 Subnet
  ```
  Network: 192.168.1.0/26

  Total IPs: 2^(32-26) = 2^6 = 64
  Usable: 64 - 2 = 62 hosts

  Network address:   192.168.1.0
  First usable:      192.168.1.1
  Last usable:       192.168.1.62
  Broadcast:         192.168.1.63
  ```

  ## Subnetting a /24 Network

  Divide 192.168.1.0/24 into 4 subnets:

  ```
  Need 4 subnets = 2^2 = borrow 2 bits
  New mask: /24 + 2 = /26

  Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0/26    (0-63)
  Subnet 2: 192.168.1.64/26   (64-127)
  Subnet 3: 192.168.1.128/26  (128-191)
  Subnet 4: 192.168.1.192/26  (192-255)
  ```

  ### Subnet Details

  | Subnet | Network | First Host | Last Host | Broadcast |
  |--------|---------|------------|-----------|-----------|
  | 1 | 192.168.1.0 | 192.168.1.1 | 192.168.1.62 | 192.168.1.63 |
  | 2 | 192.168.1.64 | 192.168.1.65 | 192.168.1.126 | 192.168.1.127 |
  | 3 | 192.168.1.128 | 192.168.1.129 | 192.168.1.190 | 192.168.1.191 |
  | 4 | 192.168.1.192 | 192.168.1.193 | 192.168.1.254 | 192.168.1.255 |

  ## Quick Reference

  | CIDR | Subnet Mask | Block Size | Usable Hosts |
  |------|-------------|------------|--------------|
  | /24 | 255.255.255.0 | 256 | 254 |
  | /25 | 255.255.255.128 | 128 | 126 |
  | /26 | 255.255.255.192 | 64 | 62 |
  | /27 | 255.255.255.224 | 32 | 30 |
  | /28 | 255.255.255.240 | 16 | 14 |
  | /29 | 255.255.255.248 | 8 | 6 |
  | /30 | 255.255.255.252 | 4 | 2 |

  ## Supernetting (Aggregation)

  Combine multiple networks into one:

  ```
  192.168.0.0/24
  192.168.1.0/24
  192.168.2.0/24
  192.168.3.0/24

  Can be summarized as: 192.168.0.0/22
  ```

  ## Tools

  ```bash
  # Calculate subnet info
  ipcalc 192.168.1.0/26

  # Show network configuration
  ip addr show

  # Check which subnet an IP belongs to
  ipcalc 192.168.1.100/26
  ```
