  Beryllium is anomalous due to small size and high charge density. BeO and Be(OH)₂
  are amphoteric, BeCl₂ is covalent (polymeric). Be does NOT react with water (protective
  oxide layer), and BeSO₄ is soluble.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'
