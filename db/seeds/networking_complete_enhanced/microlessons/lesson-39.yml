  question: What is the key difference between Blue-Green and Canary deployments?
  options:
  - Blue-Green switches traffic all at once; Canary gradually shifts traffic to the
    new version
  - Blue-Green is slower than Canary
  - Canary requires more servers
  - Blue-Green only works in Kubernetes
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: Blue-Green deployment maintains two identical environments and switches
    traffic completely. Canary deployment gradually shifts traffic (10%, 25%, 50%,
    100%), allowing monitoring and rollback.
