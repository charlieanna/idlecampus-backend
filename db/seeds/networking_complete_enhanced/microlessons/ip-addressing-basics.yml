  # IP Addressing Basics

  IP addresses are unique identifiers for devices on a network, like street addresses for computers.

  ## IPv4 Addresses

  IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers written as four octets:

  ```
  192.168.1.100
   |   |   | |
   |   |   | +-- Host portion
   |   |   +---- Host portion
   |   +-------- Network portion
   +------------ Network portion
  ```

  Each octet is 0-255 (8 bits = 256 values)

  ### IPv4 Address Classes

  | Class | Range | Default Mask | Purpose |
  |-------|-------|--------------|---------|
  | A | 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255 | 255.0.0.0 | Large networks |
  | B | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 | 255.255.0.0 | Medium networks |
  | C | 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 | 255.255.255.0 | Small networks |

  ## Private vs Public IP Addresses

  ### Private IPs (Internal/LAN)

  Used inside your network, not routable on the internet:

  ```
  Class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
  Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
  Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
  ```

  ### Public IPs (Internet)

  Unique addresses assigned by ISPs, routable on the internet.
  Example: `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS)

  ## Subnet Masks

  Subnet masks define which part of an IP is the network and which is the host:

  ```bash
  IP Address:    192.168.1.100
  Subnet Mask:   255.255.255.0

  Network:       192.168.1.0
  Host:          .100
  Broadcast:     192.168.1.255
  ```

  ### CIDR Notation

  A shorthand for subnet masks:

  ```
  /24 = 255.255.255.0    (256 addresses, 254 usable hosts)
  /16 = 255.255.0.0      (65,536 addresses)
  /8  = 255.0.0.0        (16 million addresses)

  Example: 192.168.1.0/24
  ```

  ### Common Subnets

  | CIDR | Subnet Mask | Usable Hosts |
  |------|-------------|--------------|
  | /24 | 255.255.255.0 | 254 |
  | /25 | 255.255.255.128 | 126 |
  | /26 | 255.255.255.192 | 62 |
  | /27 | 255.255.255.224 | 30 |
  | /28 | 255.255.255.240 | 14 |
  | /30 | 255.255.255.252 | 2 |

  ## Special IP Addresses

  ```
  127.0.0.1     - Localhost (loopback)
  0.0.0.0       - All interfaces / default route
  255.255.255.255 - Broadcast to all
  169.254.x.x   - Link-local (APIPA) when DHCP fails
  ```

  ## IPv6 Addresses

  128-bit addresses written in hexadecimal:

  ```
  2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

  Can be shortened:
  2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334
  ```

  ### IPv6 Special Addresses

  ```
  ::1           - Localhost
  fe80::/10     - Link-local
  2000::/3      - Global unicast (public)
  ```

  ## Checking Your IP

  ```bash
  # Linux/Mac - Show IP configuration
  ip addr show
  ifconfig

  # Windows
  ipconfig

  # Get public IP
  curl ifconfig.me
  curl ipinfo.io/ip
  ```

exercises:
  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 1
    question: Which of the following is a private IP address range?
    options:
      - 8.8.8.0 - 8.8.8.255
      - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
      - 1.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255
      - 200.0.0.0 - 200.255.255.255
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 is the Class C private IP range. Private IPs are used internally and are not routable on the public internet.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 2
    question: What does a /24 subnet mask mean?
    options:
      - 24 computers can connect
      - The first 24 bits are the network portion (255.255.255.0)
      - The network has 24 hosts
      - The IP has 24 octets
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: /24 means the first 24 bits identify the network, equivalent to 255.255.255.0. This leaves 8 bits for hosts, allowing 254 usable IP addresses.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 3
    question: What is the localhost IP address in IPv4?
    options:
      - 192.168.1.1
      - 0.0.0.0
      - 127.0.0.1
      - 255.255.255.255
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: 127.0.0.1 is the loopback address (localhost). Traffic to this address stays on the local machine and is used for testing.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 4
    question: How many usable host addresses are in a /24 network?
    options:
      - 256
      - 254
      - 255
      - 252
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: A /24 network has 256 total addresses, but 2 are reserved (network address .0 and broadcast .255), leaving 254 usable host addresses.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 5
    question: What happens when a device gets an IP address starting with 169.254?
    options:
      - It connected to the internet successfully
      - DHCP failed and it assigned itself a link-local address
      - It's using a private IP address
      - The network is using IPv6
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: 169.254.x.x addresses are APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) addresses assigned when a device cannot reach a DHCP server.

      output_contains:
        - "inet"
    hints:
      - Use 'ip addr show' or just 'ip a'
      - Look for lines starting with 'inet' to find IPv4 addresses

objectives:
  - Understand IPv4 address structure and classes
  - Differentiate between private and public IP addresses
  - Read and interpret subnet masks and CIDR notation
