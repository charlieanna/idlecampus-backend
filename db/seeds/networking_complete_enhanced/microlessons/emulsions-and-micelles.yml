  \   ## Emulsions\n\n    **Emulsion:** Colloidal system where both dispersed phase\
  \ and dispersion medium are liquids.\n\n    - Both liquids must be immiscible\n\
  \    - One liquid is dispersed in another as droplets\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Types\
  \ of Emulsions\n\n    ### 1. Oil-in-Water (O/W) Emulsion\n    - **Dispersed phase:**\
  \ Oil\n    - **Dispersion medium:** Water\n    - **Examples:**\n      - Milk (fat\
  \ in water)\n      - Vanishing cream\n      - Cod liver oil\n\n    ### 2. Water-in-Oil\
  \ (W/O) Emulsion\n    - **Dispersed phase:** Water\n    - **Dispersion medium:**\
  \ Oil\n    - **Examples:**\n      - Butter\n      - Cold cream\n      - Cod liver\
  \ oil\n\n    | Property | O/W Emulsion | W/O Emulsion |\n    |----------|--------------|--------------|\n\
  \    | Dispersed phase | Oil | Water |\n    | Dispersion medium | Water | Oil |\n\
  \    | Dilution | With water | With oil |\n    | Conductivity | Conducts electricity\
  \ | Does not conduct |\n    | Example | Milk | Butter |\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Tests\
  \ to Identify Emulsion Type\n\n    ### 1. Dilution Test\n    - **O/W:** Can be diluted\
  \ with water\n    - **W/O:** Can be diluted with oil\n\n    ### 2. Conductivity\
  \ Test\n    - **O/W:** Conducts electricity (water conducts)\n    - **W/O:** Does\
  \ not conduct (oil doesn't conduct)\n\n    ### 3. Dye Test\n    - **O/W:** Water-soluble\
  \ dye colors the emulsion\n    - **W/O:** Oil-soluble dye colors the emulsion\n\n\
  \    ---\n\n    ## Emulsifying Agents (Emulsifiers)\n\n    **Function:** Stabilize\
  \ emulsions by forming interfacial film between two liquids\n\n    **Types:**\n\n\
  \    1. **Lyophilic colloids:** Gelatin, albumin, casein\n    2. **Surface active\
  \ agents:** Soaps, detergents\n    3. **Finely divided solids:** Lampblack, clay\n\
  \n    **Mechanism:**\n    - Molecules have hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic\
  \ (water-hating) parts\n    - Form protective layer around droplets\n    - Prevent\
  \ coalescence\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Applications of Emulsions\n\n    1. **Medicines:**\
  \ Cod liver oil, liquid paraffin\n    2. **Cosmetics:** Cold cream, vanishing cream\n\
  \    3. **Food:** Milk, butter, ice cream\n    4. **Paints:** Oil-based paints\n\
  \    5. **Disinfectants:** Phenol emulsions\n    6. **Asphalt emulsions:** Road\
  \ surfacing\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Demulsification\n\n    **Process of breaking emulsion\
  \ into constituent liquids**\n\n    **Methods:**\n    1. **Heating:** Destroys emulsifying\
  \ agent\n    2. **Freezing:** Ice crystals break emulsion\n    3. **Centrifugation:**\
  \ Separates by density\n    4. **Chemical methods:** Adding electrolytes, changing\
  \ pH\n    5. **Addition of opposite type emulsifier**\n\n    **Example:** Cream\
  \ separation from milk by centrifugation\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Micelles\n\n    **Micelle:**\
  \ Aggregate of surfactant molecules in colloidal dimensions\n\n    ### Surfactants\
  \ (Surface Active Agents)\n\n    **Structure:**\n    - **Hydrophilic head:** Polar,\
  \ water-loving (COO⁻, SO₃⁻, SO₄⁻)\n    - **Hydrophobic tail:** Non-polar, water-hating\
  \ (long hydrocarbon chain)\n\n    **Example - Soap (RCOO⁻Na⁺):**\n    - Hydrophilic:\
  \ COO⁻ group\n    - Hydrophobic: Long alkyl chain (R)\n\n    ### Micelle Formation\n\
  \n    **In water:**\n    - Hydrophobic tails point inward\n    - Hydrophilic heads\
  \ point outward toward water\n    - Forms spherical aggregate\n\n    **Critical\
  \ Micelle Concentration (CMC):**\n    - Minimum concentration at which micelles\
  \ form\n    - Below CMC: Individual molecules\n    - Above CMC: Micelles form\n\n\
  \    **Kraft Temperature:**\n    - Minimum temperature for micelle formation\n \
  \   - Below this, surfactant precipitates\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Cleansing Action\
  \ of Soaps\n\n    **Mechanism:**\n\n    1. **Soap dissolves in water** and forms\
  \ micelles (above CMC)\n\n    2. **Hydrophobic tails** dissolve in grease/oil on\
  \ fabric\n       **Hydrophilic heads** remain in water\n\n    3. **Mechanical action**\
  \ (rubbing) breaks up oil into droplets\n\n    4. **Micelles surround oil droplets**\
  \ with tails inside oil and heads outside in water\n\n    5. **Repulsion between\
  \ negatively charged heads** keeps droplets dispersed (emulsion)\n\n    6. **Rinsing\
  \ with water** removes emulsified oil droplets\n\n    **Why soap doesn't work in\
  \ hard water:**\n    - Hard water contains Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺ ions\n    - Forms insoluble\
  \ salts: 2RCOO⁻Na⁺ + Ca²⁺ → (RCOO)₂Ca + 2Na⁺\n    - These precipitate as scum, reducing\
  \ cleansing action\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Detergents\n\n    **Synthetic detergents:**\
  \ Sodium salts of long-chain sulfonic acids or alkyl hydrogen sulfates\n\n    **Structure:**\n\
  \    - Example: Sodium lauryl sulfate (CH₃(CH₂)₁₁OSO₃⁻Na⁺)\n    - Long hydrocarbon\
  \ chain + sulfate group\n\n    **Advantages over soaps:**\n\n    1. **Work in hard\
  \ water:** Don't form insoluble salts with Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺\n    2. **Work in acidic solutions:**\
  \ Don't precipitate\n    3. **Stronger cleansing action**\n    4. **Better solubility\
  \ in water**\n\n    **Types:**\n\n    1. **Anionic detergents:**\n       - Negatively\
  \ charged (SO₃⁻, SO₄⁻)\n       - Example: Sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate\n   \
  \    - Best for removing oily dirt\n\n    2. **Cationic detergents:**\n       -\
  \ Positively charged (NH₄⁺)\n       - Example: Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide\n\
  \       - Used as germicides, antiseptics\n\n    3. **Non-ionic detergents:**\n\
  \       - No charge\n       - Example: Polyethylene glycol stearate\n       - Used\
  \ in dishwashing liquids\n\n    **Disadvantage:** Some detergents are not biodegradable,\
  \ causing water pollution\n\n    ---\n\n    ## IIT JEE Key Points\n\n    1. **Emulsion:**\
  \ Liquid in liquid colloidal system\n    2. **O/W emulsion:** Can be diluted with\
  \ water, conducts electricity\n    3. **W/O emulsion:** Can be diluted with oil,\
  \ doesn't conduct\n    4. **Emulsifier:** Stabilizes emulsion (gelatin, soap)\n\
  \    5. **Micelles:** Form above CMC and Kraft temperature\n    6. **Soap structure:**\
  \ Hydrophilic head (COO⁻) + Hydrophobic tail (alkyl chain)\n    7. **Cleansing:**\
  \ Micelles surround oil, emulsification occurs\n    8. **Hard water:** Forms scum\
  \ with soap (Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ salts)\n    9. **Detergents:** Work in hard water, more versatile\
  \ than soaps\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Emulsions\n\n- Emulsifying agents\n\n- Types\

  question: What is the critical micelle concentration (CMC)?
  options:
  - The minimum concentration of surfactant needed for micelle formation
  - The maximum concentration of surfactant in solution
  - The concentration at which emulsion breaks
  - The concentration of surfactant at the interface
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: CMC is the minimum concentration of surfactant at which micelles begin
    to form. Below CMC, surfactants exist as individual molecules; above CMC, they
    aggregate into micelles with hydrophobic tails inside and hydrophilic heads outside.
