  Chlorine radicals from CFCs catalytically destroy ozone: Cl· + O₃ → ClO· + O₂, ClO·
  + O → Cl· + O₂. One Cl· can destroy 100,000 O₃ molecules. This is the mechanism
  of ozone layer depletion.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following catalytically destroys ozone in the stratosphere?
  options:
  - Chlorine radicals (Cl·) from CFCs
  - Oxygen molecules (O₂)
  - Nitrogen gas (N₂)
  - Water vapor (H₂O)
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: Chlorine radicals from CFCs catalytically destroy ozone through the
    reactions Cl· + O₃ → ClO· + O₂ and ClO· + O → Cl· + O₂. One chlorine radical can
    destroy up to 100,000 ozone molecules, making it a powerful catalyst in ozone
    depletion.
objectives:
