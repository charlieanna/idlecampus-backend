  # OSI Model Fundamentals

  The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that describes how data travels through a network.

  ## The 7 Layers

  Think of OSI as layers of an onion - each layer wraps around the previous one:

  ```
  Layer 7: Application    (HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP)
  Layer 6: Presentation   (Encryption, Compression)
  Layer 5: Session        (Session Management)
  Layer 4: Transport      (TCP, UDP - Ports)
  Layer 3: Network        (IP Addresses, Routing)
  Layer 2: Data Link      (MAC Addresses, Switches)
  Layer 1: Physical       (Cables, Signals, Bits)
  ```

  ## Memory Trick

  **"Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away"**
  - **P**hysical (Layer 1)
  - **D**ata Link (Layer 2)
  - **N**etwork (Layer 3)
  - **T**ransport (Layer 4)
  - **S**ession (Layer 5)
  - **P**resentation (Layer 6)
  - **A**pplication (Layer 7)

  ## What Happens at Each Layer

  ### Layer 1 - Physical
  - Actual hardware: cables, hubs, network cards
  - Deals with raw bits (0s and 1s)
  - Examples: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, Wi-Fi radio waves

  ### Layer 2 - Data Link
  - Uses **MAC addresses** (hardware addresses)
  - Switches operate here
  - Creates frames from raw bits
  - Example: Your network card's address like `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

  ### Layer 3 - Network
  - Uses **IP addresses**
  - Routers operate here
  - Handles routing between different networks
  - Examples: `192.168.1.1`, `10.0.0.1`

  ### Layer 4 - Transport
  - **TCP**: Reliable, ordered delivery (like certified mail)
  - **UDP**: Fast, no guarantee (like regular mail)
  - Uses **ports** to identify applications
  - Examples: Port 80 (HTTP), Port 443 (HTTPS), Port 22 (SSH)

  ### Layer 5 - Session
  - Manages connections between applications
  - Handles authentication and reconnection

  ### Layer 6 - Presentation
  - Data formatting and encryption
  - Converts data between formats
  - Examples: SSL/TLS encryption, JPEG encoding

  ### Layer 7 - Application
  - What users interact with
  - Protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS

  ## Real-World Example

  When you visit a website:

  ```
  1. Application (7):  Browser requests webpage via HTTP
  2. Presentation (6): Data is encrypted with TLS
  3. Session (5):      Connection session established
  4. Transport (4):    Data split into TCP segments (port 443)
  5. Network (3):      IP address routing (destination IP)
  6. Data Link (2):    Framing with MAC addresses
  7. Physical (1):     Bits sent over cable/Wi-Fi
  ```

  ## TCP/IP Model Comparison

  In practice, the simpler **TCP/IP model** is more commonly used:

  ```
  OSI Model          TCP/IP Model
  -----------        ------------
  Application  }
  Presentation }---> Application
  Session      }
  Transport    ----> Transport
  Network      ----> Internet
  Data Link    }---> Network Access
  Physical     }
  ```

    question: How many layers does the OSI model have?
    options:
      - 4 layers
      - 5 layers
      - 7 layers
      - 10 layers
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: The OSI model has 7 layers, from Physical (Layer 1) to Application (Layer 7).

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 2
    question: Which layer is responsible for IP addressing and routing?
    options:
      - Layer 2 - Data Link
      - Layer 3 - Network
      - Layer 4 - Transport
      - Layer 7 - Application
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Layer 3 (Network) handles IP addresses and routing between networks. Routers operate at this layer.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 3
    question: At which layer do switches primarily operate?
    options:
      - Layer 1 - Physical
      - Layer 2 - Data Link
      - Layer 3 - Network
      - Layer 4 - Transport
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Switches operate at Layer 2 (Data Link) and use MAC addresses to forward frames between devices on the same network.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 4
    question: Which layer handles port numbers for TCP and UDP?
    options:
      - Layer 3 - Network
      - Layer 4 - Transport
      - Layer 5 - Session
      - Layer 7 - Application
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Layer 4 (Transport) uses port numbers to identify specific applications. TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 5
    question: What is the correct order of OSI layers from bottom to top?
    options:
      - Application, Physical, Network, Transport
      - Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
      - Network, Transport, Application, Physical
      - Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: The layers from bottom (1) to top (7) are Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.

objectives:
  - Understand the 7 layers of the OSI model
  - Identify which protocols and devices operate at each layer
  - Compare OSI to the TCP/IP model
