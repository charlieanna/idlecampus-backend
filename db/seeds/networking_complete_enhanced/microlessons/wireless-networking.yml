  # Wireless Networking

  Understanding Wi-Fi standards, security, and troubleshooting.

  ## Wi-Fi Standards (802.11)

  | Standard | Name | Frequency | Max Speed | Range |
  |----------|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
  | 802.11b | Wi-Fi 1 | 2.4 GHz | 11 Mbps | Long |
  | 802.11a | Wi-Fi 2 | 5 GHz | 54 Mbps | Short |
  | 802.11g | Wi-Fi 3 | 2.4 GHz | 54 Mbps | Long |
  | 802.11n | Wi-Fi 4 | 2.4/5 GHz | 600 Mbps | Medium |
  | 802.11ac | Wi-Fi 5 | 5 GHz | 6.9 Gbps | Medium |
  | 802.11ax | Wi-Fi 6 | 2.4/5/6 GHz | 9.6 Gbps | Medium |

  ## 2.4 GHz vs 5 GHz

  | Feature | 2.4 GHz | 5 GHz |
  |---------|---------|-------|
  | Range | Longer | Shorter |
  | Speed | Slower | Faster |
  | Interference | More (crowded) | Less |
  | Wall penetration | Better | Worse |
  | Channels | 3 non-overlapping | 23+ non-overlapping |

  **Use 2.4 GHz for**: Range, IoT devices, older devices
  **Use 5 GHz for**: Speed, streaming, gaming

  ## Wi-Fi Security

  ### Security Protocols (Best to Worst)

  | Protocol | Security | Notes |
  |----------|----------|-------|
  | **WPA3** | Excellent | Latest, use if available |
  | **WPA2** | Good | Current standard |
  | **WPA** | Weak | Outdated, avoid |
  | **WEP** | Broken | Never use |
  | **Open** | None | Public hotspots only |

  ### WPA2 vs WPA3

  **WPA2**:
  - AES encryption
  - Vulnerable to KRACK attack
  - Dictionary attacks possible

  **WPA3**:
  - Stronger encryption (SAE)
  - Forward secrecy
  - Protected against dictionary attacks
  - Easier IoT setup

  ## Wireless Commands

  ```bash
  # List wireless interfaces
  iwconfig
  ip link show

  # Scan for networks
  sudo iwlist wlan0 scan
  nmcli device wifi list

  # Connect to network
  nmcli device wifi connect "NetworkName" password "password"

  # Show current connection
  iwconfig wlan0
  nmcli connection show

  # Show signal strength
  watch -n 1 "iwconfig wlan0 | grep -i quality"

  # Disconnect
  nmcli device disconnect wlan0
  ```

  ## Troubleshooting Wi-Fi

  ### Weak Signal
  ```bash
  # Check signal strength
  iwconfig wlan0 | grep -i signal
  # -30 dBm = Excellent
  # -50 dBm = Good
  # -70 dBm = Fair
  # -80 dBm = Poor
  # -90 dBm = Unusable
  ```

  **Solutions**:
  - Move closer to router
  - Reduce interference (microwaves, Bluetooth)
  - Use 5 GHz band
  - Add access points/mesh

  ### Can't Connect
  ```bash
  # Check if interface is up
  ip link show wlan0

  # Bring interface up
  sudo ip link set wlan0 up

  # Restart NetworkManager
  sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

  # Check for driver issues
  dmesg | grep -i wifi
  lspci -k | grep -A 3 -i wireless
  ```

  ### Slow Speed
  - Check for channel congestion
  - Switch to 5 GHz
  - Update router firmware
  - Check for bandwidth hogs

  ## Channel Selection

  ```
  2.4 GHz Non-overlapping channels: 1, 6, 11

  Channel 1:  [====]
  Channel 6:        [====]
  Channel 11:             [====]
  ```

  Best practice: Use channels 1, 6, or 11 for 2.4 GHz.

  ## Access Point vs Router

  **Router**: Connects networks, NAT, DHCP, firewall
  **Access Point**: Extends wireless coverage only

  ## Mesh Networks

  Multiple access points work together:
  - Seamless roaming
  - Self-healing (if one fails)
  - Single SSID throughout
  - Examples: Google Wifi, Eero, Ubiquiti

exercises:
  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 1
    question: Which Wi-Fi security protocol should you use?
    options:
      - WEP (fastest)
      - WPA (most compatible)
      - WPA2 or WPA3 (most secure)
      - Open (easiest)
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: WPA2 or WPA3 provide strong encryption. WEP is broken, WPA is weak, and open networks have no encryption.

    question: What is the advantage of 5 GHz over 2.4 GHz?
    options:
      - Better range
      - Less interference and faster speeds
      - Works with all devices
      - Penetrates walls better
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: 5 GHz has more channels (less interference) and supports faster speeds, but has shorter range and worse wall penetration.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 3
    question: What are the recommended channels for 2.4 GHz to avoid overlap?
    options:
      - 1, 2, 3
      - 1, 6, 11
      - 5, 10, 15
      - Any channel works
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Channels 1, 6, and 11 don't overlap in the 2.4 GHz band. Using other channels causes interference.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 4
    question: What does a signal strength of -75 dBm indicate?
    options:
      - Excellent signal
      - Good signal
      - Fair/weak signal
      - No signal
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: -75 dBm is a fair/weak signal. -30 to -50 is excellent/good, -60 to -70 is fair, below -80 is poor.

  - type: mcq
    sequence_order: 5
    question: Which Wi-Fi standard is also known as Wi-Fi 6?
    options:
      - 802.11n
      - 802.11ac
      - 802.11ax
      - 802.11be
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: 802.11ax is Wi-Fi 6, offering speeds up to 9.6 Gbps and better performance in crowded environments.
