content_md: "# Microlesson \U0001F680\n\n# Kubernetes Architecture Overview\n\n  \
  \  ## Control Plane Components\n\n    ### API Server (kube-apiserver)\n    - Central\
  \ management entity\n    - Exposes Kubernetes API\n    - Frontend for the control\
  \ plane\n    - All operations go through the API server\n\n    ### etcd\n    - Consistent\
  \ and highly-available key-value store\n    - Stores all cluster data\n    - Source\
  \ of truth for cluster state\n\n    ### Scheduler (kube-scheduler)\n    - Watches\
  \ for newly created Pods\n    - Selects nodes for pods to run on\n    - Considers\
  \ resource requirements, constraints, and affinity\n\n    ### Controller Manager\
  \ (kube-controller-manager)\n    - Runs controller processes\n    - Node Controller:\
  \ Monitors node status\n    - Replication Controller: Maintains correct number of\
  \ pods\n    - Endpoints Controller: Populates endpoints objects\n    - Service Account\
  \ Controller: Creates default accounts\n\n    ## Node Components\n\n    ### kubelet\n\
  \    - Runs on each node\n    - Ensures containers are running in a Pod\n    - Communicates\
  \ with API server\n    - Manages pod lifecycle\n\n    ### kube-proxy\n    - Network\
  \ proxy on each node\n    - Implements Kubernetes Service concept\n    - Maintains\
  \ network rules\n    - Enables pod-to-pod communication\n\n    ### Container Runtime\n\
  \    - Software responsible for running containers\n    - Examples: Docker, containerd,\
  \ CRI-O\n\n    ## Add-ons\n\n    - **DNS**: Cluster DNS server (CoreDNS)\n    -\
  \ **Dashboard**: Web-based UI\n    - **Ingress Controller**: HTTP/HTTPS routing\n\
  \    - **Metrics Server**: Resource usage monitoring\n\n    ## Communication Flow\n\
  \n    1. kubectl sends request to API server\n    2. API server validates and stores\
  \ in etcd\n    3. Controllers watch for changes\n    4. Scheduler assigns pods to\
  \ nodes\n    5. kubelet pulls images and starts containers\n    6. kube-proxy configures\
  \ networking"

  question: What is the primary purpose of an Ingress controller in Kubernetes?
  options:
  - To manage external HTTP/HTTPS access to services with path and host-based routing
  - To create pods automatically
  - To manage cluster storage
  - To handle pod scheduling
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: An Ingress controller manages external access to services in a cluster,
    typically HTTP/HTTPS. It provides load balancing, SSL/TLS termination, and name-based
    virtual hosting with advanced routing rules based on paths and hostnames.
