  question: 'What is the correct order of reactivity for nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions among carboxylic acid derivatives?'
  options:
  - Acid chloride > Acid anhydride > Ester > Amide
  - Amide > Ester > Acid anhydride > Acid chloride
  - Ester > Acid chloride > Amide > Acid anhydride
  - Acid anhydride > Amide > Ester > Acid chloride
  correct_answer: Acid chloride > Acid anhydride > Ester > Amide
  explanation: "The reactivity order of carboxylic acid derivatives in nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions follows the pattern: Acid chloride > Acid anhydride > Ester > Amide > Carboxylate ion. This order is determined by two main factors: (1) the leaving group ability, and (2) the extent of resonance stabilization of the carbonyl group. Acid chlorides (R-COCl) are the most reactive because chloride (Cl⁻) is an excellent leaving group with weak resonance donation to the carbonyl carbon, making the carbonyl carbon highly electrophilic. The C-Cl bond is polar, and Cl is electronegative, which further activates the carbonyl. Acid anhydrides ((R-CO)₂O) are next in reactivity; the leaving group (RCOO⁻) is reasonably good, though not as good as Cl⁻. Esters (R-COOR') are less reactive because the alkoxy oxygen (OR') can donate electron density to the carbonyl carbon through resonance, partially stabilizing it and making it less electrophilic. The leaving group (RO⁻) is also a poorer leaving group than RCOO⁻. Amides (R-CONH₂) are the least reactive among neutral derivatives because the nitrogen lone pair strongly delocalizes into the carbonyl through resonance, significantly reducing the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon. Additionally, NH₂⁻ is a very poor leaving group. This reactivity order is crucial for understanding synthetic strategies in organic chemistry and predicting reaction outcomes."

  question: 'What products are formed when an ester (R-COOR\') is treated with LiAlH₄ (lithium aluminum hydride)?'
  options:
  - Two alcohols: R-CH₂OH and R\'-OH
  - A carboxylic acid and an alcohol
  - Two aldehydes
  - A ketone and an alcohol
  correct_answer: Two alcohols: R-CH₂OH and R\'-OH
  explanation: "When an ester undergoes reduction with lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄), a powerful reducing agent, it is completely reduced to produce two alcohols. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by hydride (H⁻) from LiAlH₄ on the carbonyl carbon, followed by cleavage of the C-O bond of the ester linkage. The acyl portion (R-CO-) is reduced all the way to a primary alcohol (R-CH₂OH), and the alkoxy portion (R'O-) is released as an alcohol (R'OH). For example, when ethyl acetate (CH₃COOCH₂CH₃) is treated with LiAlH₄ followed by aqueous workup, it yields ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) from both portions: CH₃CH₂OH (from the ethoxy group) and CH₃CH₂OH (from reduction of the acetyl group to ethanol). LiAlH₄ is a much stronger reducing agent than NaBH₄ and can reduce esters, carboxylic acids, amides, and even nitriles to alcohols or amines. This contrasts with catalytic hydrogenation, which is less effective for esters. In contrast, acidic or basic hydrolysis of an ester produces a carboxylic acid (or its salt) and an alcohol without reduction. The reduction of esters to alcohols using LiAlH₄ is an important transformation in organic synthesis, particularly for preparing diols and for converting carboxylic acid derivatives to alcohols. Care must be taken when using LiAlH₄ as it reacts violently with water and must be used in anhydrous conditions."

  question: 'In the Hoffmann bromamide reaction, what is the key structural change that occurs when an amide (R-CONH₂) is treated with Br₂ and NaOH?'
  options:
  - The amide is converted to a primary amine with one less carbon atom (R-NH₂)
  - The amide is converted to a nitrile with the same number of carbons
  - The amide is converted to a carboxylic acid
  - The amide is converted to an alcohol
  correct_answer: The amide is converted to a primary amine with one less carbon atom (R-NH₂)
  explanation: "The Hoffmann bromamide degradation (or Hoffmann rearrangement) is a unique reaction where a primary amide (R-CONH₂) is treated with bromine (Br₂) in the presence of a strong base like NaOH or KOH. The remarkable feature of this reaction is that it produces a primary amine (R-NH₂) with one carbon atom less than the starting amide, along with carbon dioxide (CO₂) as a byproduct: R-CONH₂ + Br₂ + 4NaOH → R-NH₂ + Na₂CO₃ + 2NaBr + 2H₂O. The mechanism involves several steps: (1) formation of N-bromoamide, (2) deprotonation to form N-bromoanion, (3) rearrangement where the R group migrates from carbonyl carbon to nitrogen while Br leaves, forming an isocyanate intermediate (R-N=C=O), and (4) hydrolysis of the isocyanate to give the amine and CO₂. The loss of one carbon atom (as CO₂) is the key distinguishing feature. For example, benzamide (C₆H₅CONH₂) yields aniline (C₆H₅NH₂), not benzylamine. This reaction is particularly useful for: (1) preparing primary amines from readily available carboxylic acids (via amides), (2) degrading the carbon chain by one carbon, and (3) structure determination in organic chemistry. The Hoffmann bromamide reaction complements other methods of amine synthesis and is a classic named reaction in organic chemistry frequently tested in competitive exams."
