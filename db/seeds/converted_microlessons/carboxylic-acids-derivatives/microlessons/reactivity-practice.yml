  question: What is the correct order of reactivity for acyl derivatives towards nucleophilic acyl substitution?
  options:
  - Amide > Ester > Anhydride > Acid chloride
  - Acid chloride > Anhydride > Ester > Amide
  - Ester > Amide > Acid chloride > Anhydride
  - Anhydride > Amide > Ester > Acid chloride
  correct_answer: Acid chloride > Anhydride > Ester > Amide
  explanation: "The reactivity order for nucleophilic acyl substitution is: Acid chloride > Anhydride > Ester > Amide. This order is based on leaving group ability and carbonyl carbon electrophilicity. Acid chlorides are most reactive because Cl⁻ is an excellent leaving group and the carbonyl is highly electrophilic. Amides are least reactive because NH₂⁻ is a very poor leaving group and the carbonyl is deactivated by nitrogen lone pair resonance. This reactivity order allows converting more reactive derivatives to less reactive ones but not vice versa."

  question: Why are acid chlorides more reactive than esters in nucleophilic acyl substitution?
  options:
  - Acid chlorides have higher molecular weight
  - Chloride is a better leaving group than alkoxide
  - Acid chlorides are more polar
  - Esters are stabilized by hydrogen bonding
  correct_answer: Chloride is a better leaving group than alkoxide
  explanation: "Acid chlorides are more reactive than esters because chloride (Cl⁻) is a much better leaving group than alkoxide (RO⁻). A good leaving group is a weak base - chloride is the conjugate base of strong HCl (pKa = -7), while alkoxide is the conjugate base of weak alcohol (pKa ~16). Additionally, chlorine is less able to donate electrons through resonance compared to oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon in acid chlorides more electrophilic and susceptible to nucleophilic attack."

  question: Why are amides the LEAST reactive carboxylic acid derivatives?
  options:
  - Amides have the highest molecular weight
  - The nitrogen lone pair delocalizes into the carbonyl, reducing electrophilicity
  - Amides form strong hydrogen bonds
  - The C-N bond is too short
  correct_answer: The nitrogen lone pair delocalizes into the carbonyl, reducing electrophilicity
  explanation: "Amides are the least reactive acyl derivatives because the nitrogen lone pair strongly delocalizes into the carbonyl group through resonance (R-C(O⁻)=NH₂⁺ ↔ R-CO-NH₂). This resonance has two effects: (1) it reduces the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, making it less susceptible to nucleophilic attack, and (2) it makes NH₂⁻ an extremely poor leaving group (very strong base). This resonance stabilization is so strong that it gives the C-N bond partial double bond character and makes amides essentially unreactive under mild conditions."
