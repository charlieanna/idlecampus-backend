  # Moment of Inertia: Concepts and Calculations

  ## Definition

  **Moment of Inertia (I)** is the rotational analog of mass, measuring an object's resistance to angular acceleration.

  ```
  I = Σmᵢrᵢ² (for discrete particles)

  I = ∫r²dm (for continuous mass distribution)
  ```

  Where r = perpendicular distance from rotation axis.

  ## Physical Significance

  - **Rotational inertia** - resistance to change in rotational motion
  - **τ = Iα** (analog of F = ma)
  - **KE_rot = ½Iω²** (analog of KE = ½mv²)
  - **L = Iω** (angular momentum)

  ## Standard Results for Common Shapes

  | Object | Axis | Moment of Inertia |
  |--------|------|-------------------|
  | Ring (radius R) | Through center, ⊥ to plane | MR² |
  | Ring | Diameter | MR²/2 |
  | Disc | Through center, ⊥ to plane | MR²/2 |
  | Disc | Diameter | MR²/4 |
  | Solid Sphere | Any diameter | (2/5)MR² |
  | Hollow Sphere | Any diameter | (2/3)MR² |
  | Solid Cylinder | Central axis | MR²/2 |
  | Solid Cylinder | Perpendicular axis through CM | M(R²/4 + L²/12) |
  | Rod (length L) | Center, ⊥ to length | ML²/12 |
  | Rod | End, ⊥ to length | ML²/3 |

  ## Radius of Gyration (k)

  ```
  I = Mk²

  k = √(I/M)
  ```

  k is the distance from axis where total mass can be concentrated to give same I.

  **For common shapes:**
  - Ring about center: k = R
  - Disc about center: k = R/√2
  - Solid sphere: k = R√(2/5)
  - Rod about center: k = L/√12

  ## Parallel Axis Theorem

  ```
  I = I_CM + Md²
  ```

  Where:
  - I = MOI about any axis
  - I_CM = MOI about parallel axis through CM
  - d = distance between axes

  **Key Point**: Always add Md² when moving away from CM axis.

  ### Example: Rod about end
  ```
  I_end = I_CM + M(L/2)²
  I_end = ML²/12 + ML²/4 = ML²/3
  ```

  ## Perpendicular Axis Theorem

  **Only for planar bodies (2D):**
  ```
  I_z = I_x + I_y
  ```

  Where x and y are in the plane, z is perpendicular.

  ### Example: Ring
  ```
  I_diameter + I_diameter = I_perpendicular
  2I_d = MR²
  I_d = MR²/2
  ```

  ### Example: Disc
  ```
  I_x + I_y = I_z
  2I_diameter = MR²/2
  I_diameter = MR²/4
  ```

  ## Calculation Examples

  ### 1. Rod (from first principles)
  For uniform rod of length L, mass M:
  ```
  dm = (M/L)dx
  I = ∫_{-L/2}^{L/2} x²(M/L)dx = (M/L)[x³/3]_{-L/2}^{L/2}
  I = ML²/12 (about center)
  ```

  ### 2. Disc (integration)
  Using concentric rings:
  ```
  dm = (2M/R²)r·dr
  I = ∫₀^R r²·dm = ∫₀^R r²(2M/R²)r·dr
  I = (2M/R²)∫₀^R r³dr = (2M/R²)(R⁴/4) = MR²/2
  ```

  ## Combined Systems

  For multiple bodies rotating about same axis:
  ```
  I_total = I₁ + I₂ + I₃ + ...
  ```

  ### Example: Disc with hole
  ```
  I = I_full disc - I_removed disc
  ```

  ## MOI Ratios (Important for JEE)

  Comparing same mass and radius/length:
  ```
  Ring : Disc : Sphere = 1 : 1/2 : 2/5
  ```

  For rolling down incline:
  - Lower I → Higher acceleration
  - Sphere reaches first, then disc, then ring

  ## Numerical Example

  **Problem:** A disc of mass 2 kg and radius 0.1 m rotates about an axis parallel to its central axis at distance 0.1 m from center. Find I.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  I_CM = MR²/2 = 2(0.1)²/2 = 0.01 kg·m²
  I = I_CM + Md² = 0.01 + 2(0.1)² = 0.01 + 0.02
  I = 0.03 kg·m²
  ```

  ## JEE Key Points

  1. **MOI depends on axis of rotation** (not just mass)
  2. **Parallel axis theorem always increases I**
  3. **Perpendicular axis theorem only for 2D bodies**
  4. **k² = I/M** (radius of gyration squared)
  5. **For rolling**: Total KE = ½Mv² + ½Iω² = ½Mv²(1 + k²/R²)

  question: "A thin ring of mass M and radius R is spinning about its diameter. Its moment of inertia is:"
  options:
  - "MR²"
  - "MR²/2"
  - "2MR²"
  - "MR²/4"
  correct_answer: "MR²/2"
  explanation: "Using perpendicular axis theorem: I_x + I_y = I_z, where x and y are diameters, z is perpendicular to plane. For ring: I_z = MR² (about axis ⊥ to plane through center). By symmetry, I_x = I_y (both diameters). So 2I_diameter = MR², giving I_diameter = MR²/2. This is half the MOI about perpendicular axis because mass is distributed differently - along diameter, maximum distance is R, while about perpendicular axis, all mass is at distance R."

  question: "A uniform rod of length L is pivoted at one end. The moment of inertia about this pivot is:"
  options:
  - "ML²/12"
  - "ML²/3"
  - "ML²/4"
  - "ML²/2"
  correct_answer: "ML²/3"
  explanation: "Using parallel axis theorem: I_end = I_CM + Md². For rod: I_CM = ML²/12 (about center). Distance from center to end: d = L/2. Therefore: I_end = ML²/12 + M(L/2)² = ML²/12 + ML²/4 = ML²/12 + 3ML²/12 = 4ML²/12 = ML²/3. This is 4 times the MOI about center because: (1) axis shifted by L/2, (2) Md² term is significant. This explains why pendulums pivoted at end have different period than those pivoted at center."

  question: "The radius of gyration of a solid sphere of radius R about any diameter is:"
  options:
  - "R"
  - "R√(2/5)"
  - "R/√2"
  - "R√(3/5)"
  correct_answer: "R√(2/5)"
  explanation: "For solid sphere: I = (2/5)MR². Radius of gyration k: I = Mk², so k² = I/M = (2/5)MR²/M = (2/5)R². Therefore k = R√(2/5) ≈ 0.632R. This means if entire mass were concentrated at distance 0.632R from axis, MOI would be same. Physical interpretation: Mass in sphere is distributed from r=0 to r=R, with more mass at outer regions contributing more to I. The effective distance is √(2/5)R, showing average contribution. Compare: Ring k=R, Disc k=R/√2, Sphere k=R√(2/5)."
