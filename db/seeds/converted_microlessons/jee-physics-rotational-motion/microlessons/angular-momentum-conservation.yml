  # Angular Momentum and Conservation

  ## Angular Momentum (L)

  **Definition:** Rotational analog of linear momentum.

  ### For Particle:
  ```
  L⃗ = r⃗ × p⃗ = r⃗ × mv⃗
  L = mvr sin θ = mvr⊥
  ```

  ### For Rigid Body:
  ```
  L = Iω

  I = moment of inertia
  ω = angular velocity
  ```

  **Unit:** kg·m²/s or J·s

  ## Torque and Angular Momentum

  ```
  τ⃗ = dL⃗/dt

  Net torque = Rate of change of angular momentum
  ```

  Rotational analog of F⃗ = dp⃗/dt

  ## Conservation of Angular Momentum

  **When net external torque = 0:**
  ```
  L = constant

  Iω = constant (for rotation about fixed axis)

  I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂
  ```

  ## Applications

  ### 1. Ice Skater Spin
  ```
  Arms extended: I large, ω small
  Arms pulled in: I small, ω large

  I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂ (conservation)
  ```

  ### 2. Diver's Rotation
  ```
  Tuck position: Faster rotation
  Extended position: Slower rotation
  ```

  ### 3. Ballet Pirouette
  Similar to ice skater.

  ### 4. Neutron Star
  ```
  When star collapses: R decreases
  I ∝ MR² decreases
  ω increases dramatically (millisecond pulsars)
  ```

  ### 5. Planetary Motion
  ```
  L = mvr = constant

  At perihelion: r small, v large
  At aphelion: r large, v small

  Kepler's second law: Equal areas in equal times
  ```

  ## Types of Angular Momentum

  ### 1. Spin Angular Momentum:
  ```
  L_spin = Iω (rotation about own axis)
  ```

  ### 2. Orbital Angular Momentum:
  ```
  L_orbital = mvr (motion around external axis)
  ```

  ### 3. Total:
  ```
  L_total = L_spin + L_orbital
  ```

  ## Angular Impulse

  ```
  J⃗ = ∫τ⃗ dt = ΔL⃗

  Angular impulse = Change in angular momentum
  ```

  ## Important Relations

  ### Angular Momentum of Particle in Circular Motion:
  ```
  L = mvr = mr²ω
  ```

  ### Angular Momentum of Rotating Rigid Body:
  ```
  L = Iω = (mk²)ω

  where k = radius of gyration
  ```

  ### Rolling Without Slipping:
  ```
  L_total = L_spin + L_orbital
  L = Iω + MvR = (I + MR²)ω

  For disc: L = (MR²/2 + MR²)ω = (3/2)MR²ω
  ```

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Particle of mass 2 kg moves in circle of radius 3 m with velocity 6 m/s. Find angular momentum.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  L = mvr = 2 × 6 × 3 = 36 kg·m²/s

  Or: ω = v/r = 2 rad/s
  I = mr² = 18 kg·m²
  L = Iω = 18 × 2 = 36 kg·m²/s ✓
  ```

  **Example 2:** Disc rotates at 10 rad/s. If radius halves due to contraction, find new angular velocity.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  I₁ = (1/2)MR²
  I₂ = (1/2)M(R/2)² = (1/8)MR² = I₁/4

  Conservation: I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂
  I₁(10) = (I₁/4)ω₂
  ω₂ = 40 rad/s

  Angular velocity increases 4 times!
  ```

  **Example 3:** Turntable (I = 0.1 kg·m²) rotates at 2 rad/s. Child (mass 20 kg) at center moves to edge (r = 0.5 m). Find new ω.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  I_initial = 0.1 kg·m²
  I_final = 0.1 + mr² = 0.1 + 20(0.25) = 5.1 kg·m²

  L = constant
  0.1 × 2 = 5.1 × ω₂
  ω₂ = 0.2/5.1 ≈ 0.039 rad/s

  Rotation slows dramatically when child moves out.
  ```

  ## JEE Key Points

  1. **L = Iω** (fundamental relation)
  2. **Conservation when τ_ext = 0**
  3. **L is vector** - direction along rotation axis
  4. **Kepler's 2nd law** is angular momentum conservation
  5. **Decrease I → Increase ω** (and vice versa)
  6. **Right hand rule** for direction
  7. **Both spin and orbital** contribute to total L

  ## Common Mistakes

  1. ❌ Forgetting I changes when mass distribution changes
  2. ❌ Not including both spin and orbital L
  3. ❌ Wrong sign for rotation direction
  4. ❌ Confusing L with τ
  5. ❌ Assuming conservation when external torque exists

  question: "A person on rotating platform holds weights in outstretched arms. When arms are folded, angular velocity:"
  options:
  - "Increases"
  - "Decreases"
  - "Remains same"
  - "Becomes zero"
  correct_answer: "Increases"
  explanation: "When arms are folded, weights move closer to rotation axis, decreasing moment of inertia (I ∝ r²). By conservation of angular momentum (no external torque): Iω = constant. If I decreases, ω must increase proportionally. This is dramatically demonstrated by figure skaters who spin faster by pulling arms in. A 4-fold decrease in I gives 4-fold increase in ω. The angular momentum remains constant, but kinetic energy KE = ½Iω² actually increases - the person does work by pulling arms in against centrifugal force."

  question: "Angular momentum of planet in elliptical orbit is constant. At perihelion, compared to aphelion:"
  options:
  - "Speed is less, distance is more"
  - "Speed is more, distance is less"
  - "Both speed and distance are more"
  - "Both are same"
  correct_answer: "Speed is more, distance is less"
  explanation: "L = mvr = constant. At perihelion (closest to sun): r is minimum, so v must be maximum to maintain constant L. At aphelion: r is maximum, v is minimum. This is Kepler's second law: planets sweep equal areas in equal times (dA/dt = L/2m = constant). Earth moves fastest in January (perihelion) at ~30.3 km/s and slowest in July (aphelion) at ~29.3 km/s. This ~3% variation is why Northern Hemisphere winter is slightly shorter than summer."

  question: "A disc of mass M and radius R rolls without slipping. Its angular momentum about center of mass is:"
  options:
  - "MR²ω"
  - "(1/2)MR²ω"
  - "(3/2)MR²ω"
  - "2MR²ω"
  correct_answer: "(1/2)MR²ω"
  explanation: "About center of mass, only spin angular momentum matters: L_cm = I_cm × ω = (MR²/2) × ω. The orbital angular momentum about CM is zero (CM is the reference point). If asked about total angular momentum about contact point: L_total = I_contact × ω = (3MR²/2) × ω (using parallel axis theorem). The distinction between 'about CM' vs 'about contact point' is crucial. For rolling disc: L_cm = MR²ω/2, but L_contact = 3MR²ω/2."
