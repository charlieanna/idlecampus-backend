  question: 'Buna-S is a copolymer of:'
  options:
  - Butadiene + Styrene
  - Butadiene + Acrylonitrile
  - Isoprene + Styrene
  - Ethylene + Propylene
  correct_answer: Butadiene + Styrene
  explanation: "Buna-S (also called SBR - Styrene-Butadiene Rubber) is a copolymer of butadiene (75%) and styrene (25%). It's widely used in automobile tires due to its excellent abrasion resistance. The 'Buna' comes from 'Butadiene' and 'Na' (sodium catalyst used in polymerization). Buna-N is a different synthetic rubber made from butadiene and acrylonitrile, used for oil-resistant applications. The other combinations are not used to make Buna-S."

  question: Which synthetic rubber is used for making oil-resistant products like gaskets and seals?
  options:
  - Buna-N (Nitrile rubber)
  - Buna-S
  - Natural rubber
  - Neoprene
  correct_answer: Buna-N (Nitrile rubber)
  explanation: "Buna-N (also called NBR - Nitrile Butadiene Rubber) is a copolymer of butadiene and acrylonitrile. The polar nitrile groups give it excellent resistance to oils, fuels, and other chemicals, making it ideal for gaskets, seals, and hoses in automotive and industrial applications. Buna-S is used for tires, natural rubber is not oil-resistant, and while neoprene has some oil resistance, Buna-N is specifically optimized for this purpose."

  question: 'What is the primary use of Buna-S (SBR) rubber?'
  options:
  - Automobile tires
  - Oil-resistant gaskets
  - Electrical insulation
  - Adhesives
  correct_answer: Automobile tires
  explanation: "Buna-S (Styrene-Butadiene Rubber) is primarily used in automobile tires because of its excellent abrasion resistance, good tensile strength, and low cost. About 70% of car tires and 50% of truck tires are made from SBR. It has better wear resistance than natural rubber and is more economical. Oil-resistant gaskets use Buna-N, electrical insulation uses materials like PVC or rubber, and adhesives typically use other polymers."
