  question: Which of the following is a biodegradable polymer?
  options:
  - PHBV
  - Polythene
  - PVC
  - Polystyrene
  correct_answer: PHBV
  explanation: "PHBV (poly-β-hydroxybutyrate-co-β-hydroxyvalerate) is a biodegradable polymer produced by bacteria. It can be broken down by microorganisms in the environment, making it eco-friendly. Polythene (polyethylene), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and polystyrene are all non-biodegradable synthetic polymers that persist in the environment for hundreds of years, contributing to plastic pollution. PHBV is used in packaging, medical applications, and as an alternative to conventional plastics."

  question: Why is Nylon-2-nylon-6 considered biodegradable?
  options:
  - It contains amide linkages that can be broken by enzymes
  - It dissolves in water
  - It is made from natural sources
  - It decomposes in sunlight
  correct_answer: It contains amide linkages that can be broken by enzymes
  explanation: "Nylon-2-nylon-6 is a biodegradable copolymer containing alternating nylon-2 and nylon-6 units. The amide linkages (-CO-NH-) in its structure are similar to peptide bonds in proteins, which makes them susceptible to enzymatic degradation by microorganisms in soil or water. This allows the polymer to break down naturally in the environment. It doesn't simply dissolve in water, and while it may be partially derived from natural sources, biodegradability specifically comes from the enzyme-susceptible amide bonds."

  question: Which statement about non-biodegradable polymers is correct?
  options:
  - They persist in the environment and cause pollution
  - They are broken down by bacteria within weeks
  - They are all made from natural sources
  - They are safer for the environment than biodegradable polymers
  correct_answer: They persist in the environment and cause pollution
  explanation: "Non-biodegradable polymers like polythene, PVC, and polystyrene have strong C-C backbone bonds that cannot be easily broken down by microorganisms. They persist in the environment for hundreds of years, accumulating as plastic waste in landfills and oceans, causing serious environmental pollution and harm to wildlife. They are not broken down quickly by bacteria, are typically synthetic (not from natural sources), and are definitely not safer for the environment - this is why there's a push towards biodegradable alternatives."
