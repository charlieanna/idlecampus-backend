  question: Which of the following is a synthetic polymer?
  options:
  - PVC
  - Starch
  - Cellulose
  - Natural rubber
  correct_answer: PVC
  explanation: "PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) is a synthetic polymer made by polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer. It's manufactured industrially and doesn't occur in nature. Starch is a natural polymer of glucose found in plants, cellulose is also a glucose polymer forming plant cell walls, and natural rubber is a polymer of isoprene obtained from rubber trees. All three of these occur naturally, while PVC is man-made."

  question: Based on structure, polymers can be classified as linear, branched, or cross-linked. Which type is thermosetting?
  options:
  - Cross-linked polymers
  - Linear polymers
  - Branched polymers
  - All of the above
  correct_answer: Cross-linked polymers
  explanation: "Cross-linked polymers are thermosetting plastics where polymer chains are connected by covalent bonds forming a 3D network structure. Once formed, they cannot be remolded or reshaped by heating (e.g., Bakelite). Linear and branched polymers are typically thermoplastics that can be repeatedly softened by heating and hardened by cooling because there are no cross-links between chains, only weak intermolecular forces."

  question: 'Addition polymers are formed without elimination of small molecules. Which is an addition polymer?'
  options:
  - Polythene
  - Nylon-6,6
  - Terylene
  - Bakelite
  correct_answer: Polythene
  explanation: "Polythene (polyethylene) is an addition polymer formed by the polymerization of ethylene (CH₂=CH₂) without the elimination of any small molecules - the monomers simply add to each other. Nylon-6,6 is a condensation polymer (eliminates water), Terylene is also a condensation polymer (eliminates water), and Bakelite is a condensation polymer (eliminates water from phenol and formaldehyde)."
