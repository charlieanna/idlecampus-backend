  question: 'Vulcanization of rubber involves heating with:'
  options:
  - Sulfur
  - Oxygen
  - Nitrogen
  - Chlorine
  correct_answer: Sulfur
  explanation: "Vulcanization is the process of heating natural rubber with sulfur (typically 1-5%) to create cross-links between polymer chains. These sulfur bridges transform soft, sticky natural rubber into a stronger, more elastic, and temperature-resistant material. The process was discovered by Charles Goodyear in 1839. Other elements like oxygen, nitrogen, or chlorine are not used for vulcanization - sulfur is specifically chosen because it forms stable covalent bonds between the polyisoprene chains."
