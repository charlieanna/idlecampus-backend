  Bakelite (phenol + formaldehyde) is thermosetting - cross-linked structure, cannot
  be melted once set. Used in electrical switches.


  ## Key Points

  question: 'Bakelite is an example of:'
  options:
  - Thermosetting plastic
  - Thermoplastic
  - Addition polymer
  - Elastomer
  correct_answer: Thermosetting plastic
  explanation: "Bakelite (phenol-formaldehyde resin) is a thermosetting plastic - it forms extensive cross-links during curing and cannot be remelted or reshaped once set. When heated initially, it hardens permanently due to chemical cross-linking. This is different from thermoplastics (like polythene) which can be repeatedly melted and reshaped. Bakelite is used in electrical switches, plugs, and other heat-resistant applications. It's a condensation polymer, not an addition polymer, and it's rigid, not an elastomer."

  question: What happens when a thermosetting plastic is heated after it has been molded?
  options:
  - It does not soften or melt
  - It melts and can be remolded
  - It becomes more flexible
  - It dissolves in solvents
  correct_answer: It does not soften or melt
  explanation: "Thermosetting plastics, once molded and cured, undergo irreversible chemical changes that create a rigid, cross-linked 3D network structure. When heated again, they do not soften or melt - instead, they may char or decompose at very high temperatures. This is because the cross-links are strong covalent bonds that cannot be easily broken. This property makes them excellent for high-temperature applications like electrical components, but they cannot be recycled by melting like thermoplastics."

  question: Which of the following is NOT a thermosetting plastic?
  options:
  - Polythene
  - Bakelite
  - Melamine
  - Urea-formaldehyde resin
  correct_answer: Polythene
  explanation: "Polythene (polyethylene) is a thermoplastic, not a thermosetting plastic. It can be repeatedly heated, melted, and remolded because it has linear or branched chains with only weak intermolecular forces between them. Bakelite (phenol-formaldehyde), melamine-formaldehyde, and urea-formaldehyde resins are all thermosetting plastics with cross-linked structures that cannot be remelted once formed."
