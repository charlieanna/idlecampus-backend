  Nylon-6,6: Adipic acid (6C) + Hexamethylenediamine (6C) → polyamide + H₂O. Terylene
  uses ethylene glycol + terephthalic acid. Bakelite uses phenol + formaldehyde.

  question: 'Nylon-6,6 is formed by condensation of:'
  options:
  - Adipic acid + Hexamethylenediamine
  - Ethylene glycol + Terephthalic acid
  - Phenol + Formaldehyde
  - Butadiene + Styrene
  correct_answer: Adipic acid + Hexamethylenediamine
  explanation: "Nylon-6,6 is a polyamide formed by the condensation polymerization of adipic acid (a 6-carbon dicarboxylic acid) and hexamethylenediamine (a 6-carbon diamine), with the elimination of water molecules. The '6,6' indicates that both monomers have 6 carbon atoms. Ethylene glycol + terephthalic acid forms Terylene (polyester), phenol + formaldehyde forms Bakelite (thermosetting plastic), and butadiene + styrene forms Buna-S (synthetic rubber) - these are different polymers."

  question: 'Terylene (Dacron) is a polyester formed from:'
  options:
  - Ethylene glycol + Terephthalic acid
  - Adipic acid + Hexamethylenediamine
  - Glycerol + Phthalic acid
  - Phenol + Formaldehyde
  correct_answer: Ethylene glycol + Terephthalic acid
  explanation: "Terylene (also called Dacron or PET - polyethylene terephthalate) is a polyester formed by condensation polymerization of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid, with elimination of water. It's widely used in textile fibers, bottles, and films. Adipic acid + hexamethylenediamine forms Nylon-6,6 (a polyamide), glycerol + phthalic acid forms Glyptal resin, and phenol + formaldehyde forms Bakelite."

  question: What small molecule is typically eliminated during condensation polymerization?
  options:
  - Water (H₂O)
  - Carbon dioxide (CO₂)
  - Ammonia (NH₃)
  - Hydrogen (H₂)
  correct_answer: Water (H₂O)
  explanation: "In condensation polymerization, water (H₂O) is the most commonly eliminated small molecule. For example, in Nylon-6,6 formation, water is eliminated when the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of adipic acid reacts with the amine group (-NH₂) of hexamethylenediamine. Similarly, in Terylene formation, water is eliminated when carboxylic acid reacts with hydroxyl groups. Other molecules like HCl, NH₃, or CH₃OH can be eliminated in specific cases, but water is most common."
