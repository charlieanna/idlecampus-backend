  Teflon (Polytetrafluoroethylene, -(CF₂-CF₂)ₙ-) is used in non-stick cookware. Very
  chemically inert, high heat resistance.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which polymer is used in non-stick cookware?
  options:
  - Teflon (PTFE)
  - PVC
  - Nylon-6,6
  - Polystyrene
  correct_answer: Teflon (PTFE)
  explanation: "Teflon (Polytetrafluoroethylene, -(CF₂-CF₂)ₙ-) is the polymer used in non-stick cookware due to its extremely low coefficient of friction and high chemical inertness. The carbon-fluorine bonds make it highly stable and resistant to heat (can withstand temperatures up to 260°C). PVC is used in pipes and electrical insulation, Nylon-6,6 in textiles and fibers, and polystyrene in packaging materials - none of these have the non-stick properties of Teflon."

  question: Which polymer is commonly used for making plastic bottles and containers?
  options:
  - PET (Polyethylene terephthalate)
  - Teflon
  - Bakelite
  - Natural rubber
  correct_answer: PET (Polyethylene terephthalate)
  explanation: "PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) is widely used for making plastic bottles, especially for beverages, and food containers because it's lightweight, strong, transparent, and acts as a good barrier to moisture and gases. Teflon is used for non-stick coatings, Bakelite is a thermosetting plastic used for electrical switches and handles, and natural rubber is used for tires and elastic materials - none are suitable for bottles."

  question: Bakelite is used for making electrical switches and handles because it is:
  options:
  - Thermosetting and a poor conductor of electricity
  - Thermoplastic and flexible
  - Biodegradable and eco-friendly
  - Transparent and lightweight
  correct_answer: Thermosetting and a poor conductor of electricity
  explanation: "Bakelite (phenol-formaldehyde resin) is a thermosetting plastic that becomes hard and rigid when heated, and cannot be remolded. It's an excellent electrical insulator (poor conductor of electricity) and heat resistant, making it ideal for electrical switches, plugs, and handles. Unlike thermoplastics, it doesn't soften on heating. It's not biodegradable, transparent, or flexible - properties that would be unsuitable for electrical applications."
