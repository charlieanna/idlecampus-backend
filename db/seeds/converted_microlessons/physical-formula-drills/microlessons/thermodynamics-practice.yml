  question: What is the relationship between Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy?
  options:
  - ΔG = ΔH - TΔS
  - ΔG = ΔH + TΔS
  - ΔG = TΔS - ΔH
  - ΔG = ΔH/TΔS
  correct_answer: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS
  explanation: "The Gibbs free energy equation is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, where ΔG is Gibbs free energy change, ΔH is enthalpy change, T is absolute temperature (K), and ΔS is entropy change. For spontaneous processes at constant T and P: ΔG < 0. At equilibrium: ΔG = 0."

  question: What is the relationship between Gibbs free energy and equilibrium constant?
  options:
  - ΔG° = -RT ln K
  - ΔG° = RT ln K
  - ΔG° = -nF ln K
  - ΔG° = K/RT
  correct_answer: ΔG° = -RT ln K
  explanation: "The relationship is ΔG° = -RT ln K, where ΔG° is standard Gibbs free energy change, R is gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K), T is temperature (K), and K is equilibrium constant. Also: ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q. When ΔG° < 0, K > 1 (products favored); when ΔG° > 0, K < 1 (reactants favored)."

  question: What is the first law of thermodynamics?
  options:
  - ΔU = q + w
  - ΔU = q - w
  - ΔU = qp
  - ΔU = w only
  correct_answer: ΔU = q + w
  explanation: "The first law of thermodynamics is ΔU = q + w, where ΔU is change in internal energy, q is heat absorbed by the system, and w is work done on the system. Using sign convention where w = -PΔV (work done by system), it becomes ΔU = q - PΔV. For constant pressure: ΔH = ΔU + PΔV = qp."
