  question: What is the relationship between Kp and Kc for gaseous equilibria?
  options:
  - Kp = Kc(RT)^Δn
  - Kp = Kc/RT
  - Kp = Kc + RT
  - Kp = Kc - Δn
  correct_answer: Kp = Kc(RT)^Δn
  explanation: "The relationship is Kp = Kc(RT)^Δn, where Kp is equilibrium constant in pressure, Kc is equilibrium constant in concentration, R is gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K), T is temperature (K), and Δn = (moles of gaseous products) - (moles of gaseous reactants). When Δn = 0, Kp = Kc."

  question: What is the formula for boiling point elevation?
  options:
  - ΔTb = Kb × m
  - ΔTb = Kb/m
  - ΔTb = m/Kb
  - ΔTb = Kb × M
  correct_answer: ΔTb = Kb × m
  explanation: "Boiling point elevation is given by ΔTb = Kb × m, where ΔTb is increase in boiling point, Kb is ebullioscopic constant (molal boiling point elevation constant, depends on solvent), and m is molality of solution. This is a colligative property depending on number of solute particles."

  question: What is the formula for osmotic pressure?
  options:
  - π = MRT
  - π = mRT
  - π = CRT
  - π = nRT/V
  correct_answer: π = MRT
  explanation: "Osmotic pressure is given by π = MRT (also written as π = CRT or π = (n/V)RT), where π is osmotic pressure, M (or C) is molar concentration, R is gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K), and T is temperature (K). This is analogous to the ideal gas law."
