  question: What is the ideal gas law equation?
  options:
  - PV = nRT
  - PV = RT
  - P = nRT/V
  - V = nRT
  correct_answer: PV = nRT
  explanation: "The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, where P is pressure, V is volume, n is number of moles, R is gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K or 8.314 J/mol·K), and T is absolute temperature (K). This combines Boyle's, Charles's, and Avogadro's laws."

  question: What is Graham's law of diffusion/effusion?
  options:
  - r₁/r₂ = √(M₂/M₁)
  - r₁/r₂ = √(M₁/M₂)
  - r₁/r₂ = M₂/M₁
  - r₁/r₂ = M₁/M₂
  correct_answer: r₁/r₂ = √(M₂/M₁)
  explanation: "Graham's law states r₁/r₂ = √(M₂/M₁), where r₁ and r₂ are rates of diffusion/effusion, and M₁ and M₂ are molar masses. Lighter gases diffuse faster than heavier gases. The rate is inversely proportional to the square root of molar mass."

  question: What is the van der Waals equation for real gases?
  options:
  - (P + an²/V²)(V - nb) = nRT
  - (P - an²/V²)(V + nb) = nRT
  - PV + an²/V² = nRT
  - P(V - nb) = nRT
  correct_answer: (P + an²/V²)(V - nb) = nRT
  explanation: "The van der Waals equation is (P + an²/V²)(V - nb) = nRT, where 'a' corrects for intermolecular attractions (pressure correction) and 'b' corrects for molecular volume (volume correction). For ideal gases (a = 0, b = 0), it reduces to PV = nRT."
