  Z = Zusammen (German for "together"). Higher priority groups on the same side →
  Z. E = Entgegen (opposite) → higher priority groups on opposite sides.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: In the E-Z nomenclature system, what does "Z" stand for?
  options:
  - Zero - groups are at 0° angle
  - Zusammen - higher priority groups on same side
  - Zipper - groups are close together
  - Z-axis - groups are aligned vertically
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Zusammen - higher priority groups on same side
  explanation: In the E-Z nomenclature system for naming geometrical isomers, Z stands
    for 'Zusammen', a German word meaning 'together'. The Z-isomer has the higher
    priority groups (determined by Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules) on the same side of the
    double bond. E stands for 'Entgegen' (German for 'opposite'), where higher priority
    groups are on opposite sides. This system is more general than cis/trans because
    it works for all alkenes, including those where cis/trans nomenclature is ambiguous.
    For example, in 2-bromo-2-butene, if Br and C₂H₅ (higher priority groups) are
    on the same side, it's Z-configuration.
