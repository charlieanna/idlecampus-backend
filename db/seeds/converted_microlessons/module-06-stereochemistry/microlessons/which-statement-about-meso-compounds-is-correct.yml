  question: Which statement about meso compounds is CORRECT?
  options:
  - They have no chiral centers
  - They are optically active
  - They have an internal plane of symmetry
  - They are mirror images of each other
  correct_answer: They have an internal plane of symmetry
  explanation: "Meso compounds are unique stereoisomers that possess chiral centers (stereogenic centers) but have an internal plane of symmetry (mirror plane) that makes the molecule achiral overall and optically inactive. The two halves of the molecule are mirror images of each other, causing their optical rotations to cancel internally. Classic example: meso-tartaric acid has two chiral centers but a plane of symmetry bisecting the molecule. Meso compounds are: (1) NOT optically active (cannot rotate plane-polarized light), (2) superimposable on their mirror images (achiral), (3) diastereomers of the chiral stereoisomers with the same molecular formula. For a molecule with n chiral centers, the maximum stereoisomers is 2ⁿ, but meso compounds reduce this number."
