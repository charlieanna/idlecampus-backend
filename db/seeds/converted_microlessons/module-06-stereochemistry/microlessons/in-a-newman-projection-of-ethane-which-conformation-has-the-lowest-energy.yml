  energy? 🚀


  Staggered conformation has the lowest energy (most stable) because bonds are 60°
  apart, minimizing electron repulsion. Eclipsed has maximum repulsion (0° dihedral
  angle). Gauche and anti are specific to molecules like butane.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: In a Newman projection of ethane, which conformation has the LOWEST energy?
  options:
  - Eclipsed
  - Staggered
  - Gauche
  - Anti
  correct_answer: Staggered
  explanation: "In a Newman projection of ethane (H₃C-CH₃), the staggered conformation has the lowest energy and is most stable. In this conformation, the C-H bonds on the front and back carbons are 60° apart (dihedral angle = 60°), maximizing the distance between electron clouds and minimizing torsional strain. The energy is approximately 12 kJ/mol lower than the eclipsed conformation, where bonds are aligned (dihedral = 0°) causing maximum electron repulsion. Ethane rapidly rotates through these conformations at room temperature. Note: 'gauche' and 'anti' are terms used for substituted alkanes like butane, not ethane. For butane, anti-staggered (dihedral = 180°) is lowest energy, followed by gauche-staggered (60°), then eclipsed conformations."
