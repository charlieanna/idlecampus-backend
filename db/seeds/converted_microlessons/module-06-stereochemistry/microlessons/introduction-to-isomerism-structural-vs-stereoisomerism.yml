  \    **Isomers** are compounds with the **same molecular formula** but **different\
  \ structures** or **spatial arrangements**.\n\n    **Example:**\n    ```\n    C₄H₁₀\
  \ has two isomers:\n\n    1. n-Butane:     CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃\n    2. Isobutane:  \
  \  CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₃\n    ```\n\n    Both have the same molecular formula (C₄H₁₀)\
  \ but different structures.\n\n    ---\n\n    ## 2. Types of Isomerism\n\n    ```\n\

  \n    ## 3. Structural Isomerism\n\n    ### A. Chain Isomerism (Skeletal Isomerism)\n\
  \    Isomers differ in the **carbon skeleton** (branching pattern).\n\n    **Example:\
  \ C₅H₁₂ (Pentane)**\n    ```\n    1. n-Pentane:        CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃\n\n \
  \   2. Isopentane:       CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃\n\n    3. Neopentane:       C(CH₃)₄\n\
  \    ```\n\n    ### B. Position Isomerism\n    Isomers differ in the **position\
  \ of functional group** or substituent on the same carbon chain.\n\n    **Example:\
  \ C₃H₇Cl (Chloropropane)**\n    ```\n    1. 1-Chloropropane:  CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-Cl\n\n\
  \    2. 2-Chloropropane:  CH₃-CHCl-CH₃\n    ```\n\n    **Example: C₃H₈O (Propanol)**\n\
  \    ```\n    1. 1-Propanol:       CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-OH\n\n    2. 2-Propanol:       CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₃\n\
  \    ```\n\n    ### C. Functional Group Isomerism\n    Isomers have **different\
  \ functional groups**.\n\n    **Example: C₃H₆O**\n    ```\n    1. Propanal (aldehyde):\
  \     CH₃-CH₂-CHO\n\n    2. Propanone (ketone):      CH₃-CO-CH₃\n\n    3. Allyl\
  \ alcohol:           CH₂=CH-CH₂-OH\n\n    4. Propylene oxide:         CH₃-CH-CH₂\n\
  \                                    \\__O__/\n    ```\n\n    **Common functional\
  \ group isomer pairs:**\n    - **Alcohols** and **Ethers**: CₙH₂ₙ₊₂O\n    - **Aldehydes**\
  \ and **Ketones**: CₙH₂ₙO\n    - **Carboxylic acids** and **Esters**: CₙH₂ₙO₂\n\
  \    - **Alkynes** and **Dienes**: CₙH₂ₙ₋₂\n\n    ### D. Metamerism\n    Isomers\
  \ differ in the **distribution of carbon atoms around a functional group** (special\
  \ case of position isomerism for ethers, ketones, etc.).\n\n    **Example: C₄H₁₀O\
  \ (Ethers)**\n    ```\n    1. Diethyl ether:            CH₃-CH₂-O-CH₂-CH₃\n\n  \
  \  2. Methyl propyl ether:      CH₃-O-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃\n    ```\n\n    ### E. Tautomerism\
  \ (Dynamic Isomerism)\n    Isomers exist in **equilibrium** by migration of a proton\
  \ and shift of a double bond.\n\n    **Example: Keto-Enol Tautomerism**\n    ```\n\
  \    Keto form              ⇌              Enol form\n    CH₃-CO-CH₃           \
  \                 CH₂=C(OH)-CH₃\n    (Acetone, 99.99%)                     (<0.01%)\n\
  \    ```\n\n    **Example: Phenol (no tautomerism):**\n    - Phenol does NOT show\
  \ keto-enol tautomerism because it would lose aromatic stability\n\n    ---\n\n\
  \    ## 4. Stereoisomerism - Introduction\n\n    ### Definition\n    **Stereoisomers**\
  \ have the same structural formula but differ in **spatial arrangement** of atoms.\n\
  \n    ### Key Difference from Structural Isomers\n    - **Structural isomers:**\
  \ Different connectivity of atoms\n    - **Stereoisomers:** Same connectivity, different\
  \ 3D arrangement\n\n    ### Types of Stereoisomerism\n\n    #### A. Configurational\
  \ Isomerism\n    - **Configuration** is **fixed** and cannot be interconverted without\
  \ breaking bonds\n    - Two types:\n      1. **Optical isomerism** (chirality-based)\n\
  \      2. **Geometrical isomerism** (restricted rotation)\n\n    #### B. Conformational\
  \ Isomerism\n    - **Conformers** can be interconverted by **rotation** around single\
  \ bonds\n    - No bond breaking required\n    - Rapidly interconverting at room\
  \ temperature\n\n    ---\n\n    ## 5. Configurational vs Conformational Isomers\n\
  \n    | Property | Configurational | Conformational |\n    |----------|-----------------|----------------|\n\
  \    | **Bond breaking** | Required | Not required |\n    | **Interconversion**\
  \ | Not possible at room temp | Rapid at room temp |\n    | **Energy barrier** |\
  \ High | Low |\n    | **Stability** | Fixed | Different conformers have different\
  \ energies |\n    | **Isolation** | Can be isolated | Usually cannot be isolated\
  \ |\n    | **Examples** | Enantiomers, cis-trans | Eclipsed, staggered |\n\n   \
  \ ---\n\n    ## 6. Importance of Stereochemistry\n\n    ### In Biological Systems\n\
  \    - **Drug activity:** Only one stereoisomer may be active\n    - **Example:**\
  \ L-DOPA (Parkinson's treatment) vs D-DOPA (inactive)\n    - **Example:** Thalidomide\
  \ - one enantiomer caused birth defects\n\n    ### In Chemical Reactions\n    -\
  \ **Selectivity:** Reactions may produce specific stereoisomers\n    - **Mechanism\
  \ understanding:** Stereochemistry reveals reaction pathways\n\n    ### In IIT JEE\n\
  \    - **High weightage topic** (5-8% of organic chemistry)\n    - **Conceptual\
  \ questions** on chirality, optical activity, R/S nomenclature\n    - **Numerical\
  \ problems** on specific rotation\n    - **Mechanism questions** involving stereochemistry\n\
  \n    ---\n\n    ## 7. Key Terms to Remember\n\n    | Term | Definition |\n    |------|------------|\n\
  \    | **Isomers** | Same molecular formula, different structure/arrangement |\n\
  \    | **Constitutional isomers** | Different connectivity (structural isomers)\
  \ |\n    | **Stereoisomers** | Same connectivity, different spatial arrangement\
  \ |\n    | **Configuration** | Fixed 3D arrangement (requires bond breaking to change)\
  \ |\n    | **Conformation** | Spatial arrangement from rotation (no bond breaking)\
  \ |\n    | **Chirality** | Non-superimposable on mirror image |\n    | **Enantiomers**\
  \ | Non-superimposable mirror images |\n    | **Diastereomers** | Non-mirror image\
  \ stereoisomers |\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Important Points for IIT JEE\n\n    1. **Count\
  \ all possible isomers systematically:**\n       - Start with straight chain, then\
  \ branched\n       - Consider all positions for functional groups\n       - Don't\
  \ forget stereoisomers\n\n    2. **Identify isomer type:**\n       - Check molecular\
  \ formula first\n       - Determine connectivity (structural vs stereoisomerism)\n\
  \       - Check for chirality or restricted rotation\n\n    3. **Tautomerism requires:**\n\
  \       - α-hydrogen (H on carbon adjacent to C=O)\n       - Enolizable hydrogen\n\
  \       - Usually keto form is more stable\n\n    4. **Functional group isomerism:**\n\
  \       - Memorize common pairs (alcohol-ether, aldehyde-ketone, etc.)\n       -\

  question: "How many chain isomers (structural isomers) does pentane (C₅H₁₂) have?"
  options:
  - "2"
  - "3"
  - "4"
  - "5"
  correct_answer: "3"
  explanation: "Pentane (C₅H₁₂) has exactly three chain isomers, which differ in the arrangement of the carbon skeleton. These are: (1) n-Pentane: CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ (straight chain with all carbons in a row), (2) Isopentane (2-methylbutane): CH₃-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃ (four-carbon chain with one methyl branch on the second carbon), and (3) Neopentane (2,2-dimethylpropane): C(CH₃)₄ (three-carbon chain with two methyl branches on the central carbon, forming a highly symmetric structure). All three isomers have the same molecular formula (C₅H₁₂) but different physical properties: n-pentane has bp 36°C, isopentane has bp 28°C, and neopentane has bp 9.5°C. The boiling points decrease as branching increases because branched molecules have less surface area contact, leading to weaker van der Waals forces. Chain isomerism is a type of structural isomerism where compounds differ in the carbon skeleton arrangement, and the number of possible isomers increases rapidly with molecular size."

  question: "Which of the following pairs are functional group isomers?"
  options:
  - "1-Propanol and 2-propanol"
  - "Propanal (CH₃CH₂CHO) and propanone (CH₃COCH₃)"
  - "n-Butane and isobutane"
  - "cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene"
  correct_answer: "Propanal (CH₃CH₂CHO) and propanone (CH₃COCH₃)"
  explanation: "Propanal and propanone are functional group isomers because they have the same molecular formula (C₃H₆O) but different functional groups—propanal is an aldehyde (-CHO group) while propanone is a ketone (C=O group between two carbons). Functional group isomerism occurs when compounds with the same molecular formula contain different functional groups. Other common examples of functional group isomers include alcohols and ethers (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂O), carboxylic acids and esters (CₙH₂ₙO₂), and alkynes and dienes (CₙH₂ₙ₋₂). In contrast, 1-propanol and 2-propanol are position isomers (same functional group, different position), n-butane and isobutane are chain isomers (different carbon skeletons), and cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene are geometrical isomers (different spatial arrangements). Functional group isomers typically have very different chemical properties because different functional groups undergo different characteristic reactions."

  question: "What is the key difference between conformational isomers and configurational isomers?"
  options:
  - "Conformational isomers have different molecular formulas"
  - "Conformational isomers can interconvert by rotation around single bonds, while configurational isomers require bond breaking"
  - "Configurational isomers can be separated easily at room temperature"
  - "Conformational isomers are always chiral"
  correct_answer: "Conformational isomers can interconvert by rotation around single bonds, while configurational isomers require bond breaking"
  explanation: "The fundamental difference between conformational and configurational isomers lies in the ease of interconversion. Conformational isomers (conformers) arise from rotation around single (sigma) bonds and can rapidly interconvert at room temperature without breaking any bonds. For example, the staggered and eclipsed conformations of ethane continuously interconvert as the molecule rotates. Because of this rapid interconversion, conformers cannot be isolated and stored separately at room temperature. In contrast, configurational isomers (which include optical isomers like enantiomers and geometrical isomers like cis-trans) require breaking and reforming covalent bonds to interconvert. This makes them stable, isolable isomers with distinct properties. For instance, converting cis-2-butene to trans-2-butene requires breaking the pi bond, rotating the molecule, and reforming the pi bond, which doesn't happen spontaneously at room temperature. Understanding this distinction is crucial in organic chemistry, particularly in understanding reaction mechanisms and stereochemistry."
