  Functional group isomers have different functional groups: Ethanol (alcohol) and
  dimethyl ether (ether) are C₂H₆O; Propanal (aldehyde) and propanone (ketone) are
  C₃H₆O. 1-Propanol and 2-propanol are position isomers.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following pairs are functional group isomers?
  options:
  - Ethanol and dimethyl ether
  - Propanal and propanone
  - 1-Propanol and 2-propanol
  - Propyne and allene
  correct_answer: Propanal and propanone
  explanation: "Propanal (CH₃CH₂CHO, an aldehyde) and propanone (CH₃COCH₃, a ketone) are functional group isomers. Both have the molecular formula C₃H₆O but contain different functional groups - aldehyde vs ketone. This is a type of structural isomerism where compounds with the same formula have different functional groups. Other examples include: (1) Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH, alcohol) and dimethyl ether (CH₃OCH₃, ether) - both C₂H₆O (though option 1 also qualifies). (2) Propanoic acid vs methyl ethanoate (both C₃H₆O₂). The pair 1-propanol and 2-propanol are position isomers (both alcohols), not functional group isomers. Propyne and allene are also functional group isomers (alkyne vs cumulated diene)."
