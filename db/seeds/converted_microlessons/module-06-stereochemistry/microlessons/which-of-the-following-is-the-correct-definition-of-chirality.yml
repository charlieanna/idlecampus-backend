  Chirality means non-superimposability on mirror image. While chiral molecules usually
  have chiral centers and are optically active, the fundamental definition is about
  mirror image non-superimposability.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following is the correct definition of chirality?
  options:
  - A molecule that rotates plane-polarized light
  - A molecule with a chiral center
  - A molecule that is non-superimposable on its mirror image
  - A molecule with an asymmetric carbon atom
  correct_answer: A molecule that is non-superimposable on its mirror image
  explanation: "The fundamental definition of chirality is that an object (molecule) is non-superimposable on its mirror image, like your left and right hands. This is the most general and accurate definition. While chiral molecules typically: (1) rotate plane-polarized light (optical activity), (2) contain chiral/stereogenic centers (sp³ carbons with 4 different groups), and (3) have asymmetric carbon atoms - these are consequences or common features of chirality, not the definition itself. For example, allenes and spiranes can be chiral without asymmetric carbons. The key test is always: can the molecule be superimposed on its mirror image? If no, it's chiral. Chirality requires lack of improper rotation axes (no plane of symmetry, center of inversion, or rotation-reflection axis)."
