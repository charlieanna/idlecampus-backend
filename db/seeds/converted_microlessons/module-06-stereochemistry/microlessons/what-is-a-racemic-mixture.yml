  A racemic mixture (racemate) is a 1:1 mixture of both enantiomers. The equal and
  opposite rotations cancel out, making it optically inactive. Notation: (±) or rac-.


  ## Key Points

  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers that is optically inactive
  explanation: A racemic mixture (racemate) is an equimolar (1:1) mixture of both
    enantiomers of a chiral compound, denoted as (±) or rac-. Because the two enantiomers
    rotate plane-polarized light by equal amounts in opposite directions (one +α,
    the other -α), their optical rotations cancel out, making the racemic mixture
    optically inactive ([α] = 0). Racemic mixtures commonly form in non-stereoselective
    syntheses (e.g., SN1 reactions with planar carbocations) and differ from pure
    enantiomers which are optically active. Resolution techniques (crystallization,
    chromatography, enzymatic) can separate racemates into pure enantiomers. Meso
    compounds are different - they're single optically inactive molecules with internal
    symmetry.
