  isomers? 🚀


  Conformational isomers (conformers) can interconvert by rotation around single bonds
  without breaking any bonds. Configurational isomers require bond breaking to interconvert.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the key difference between configurational and conformational
    isomers?
  options:
  - Configurational isomers have different molecular formulas
  - Conformational isomers can interconvert without breaking bonds
  - Configurational isomers can be easily separated
  - Conformational isomers have different functional groups
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Conformational isomers can interconvert without breaking bonds
  explanation: 'The key difference is the energy barrier to interconversion. Conformational
    isomers (conformers) can interconvert rapidly by rotation around single (σ) bonds
    without breaking any bonds - the barrier is typically 10-20 kJ/mol (thermal energy
    at room temperature). Examples: staggered ↔ eclipsed ethane, chair ↔ boat cyclohexane.
    Configurational isomers require breaking and reforming covalent bonds to interconvert,
    with much higher energy barriers (>200 kJ/mol). Examples include enantiomers,
    diastereomers, and E/Z isomers (need to break π bond). At room temperature, conformers
    rapidly interconvert and cannot be isolated, while configurational isomers are
    stable and separable.'
