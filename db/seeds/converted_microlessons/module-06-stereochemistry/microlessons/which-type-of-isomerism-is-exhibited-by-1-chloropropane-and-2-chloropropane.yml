  These compounds have the same carbon chain but differ in the position of the chlorine
  atom. This is position isomerism.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which type of isomerism is exhibited by 1-chloropropane and 2-chloropropane?
  options:
  - Chain isomerism
  - Position isomerism
  - Functional group isomerism
  - Metamerism
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Position isomerism
  explanation: 1-chloropropane (CH₃CH₂CH₂Cl) and 2-chloropropane (CH₃CHClCH₃) exhibit
    position isomerism (also called regioisomerism), a type of structural isomerism.
    Both have the same molecular formula (C₃H₇Cl) and the same carbon skeleton (propane),
    but differ in the position where the chlorine substituent is attached. In 1-chloropropane,
    Cl is on carbon-1 (terminal), while in 2-chloropropane, Cl is on carbon-2 (middle).
    This differs from chain isomerism (different carbon skeletons), functional group
    isomerism (different functional groups), and metamerism (different alkyl groups
    around a functional group in ethers/amines).
