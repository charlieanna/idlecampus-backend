  trans-2-butene is more stable because the two CH₃ groups are on opposite sides of
  the double bond (180° apart), minimizing steric repulsion. In cis, they are on the
  same side causing repulsion.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Why is trans-2-butene MORE STABLE than cis-2-butene?
  options:
  - trans has stronger C=C bond
  - trans has less steric repulsion between CH₃ groups
  - trans has more hydrogen bonding
  - trans has higher dipole moment
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: trans has less steric repulsion between CH₃ groups
  explanation: 'trans-2-butene (E-2-butene) is more stable than cis-2-butene (Z-2-butene)
    by approximately 4 kJ/mol due to reduced steric strain. In the trans isomer, the
    two methyl groups are on opposite sides of the C=C double bond (180° apart), minimizing
    steric repulsion between their electron clouds. In the cis isomer, both CH₃ groups
    are on the same side, bringing them closer in space (~2.5 Å apart), causing steric
    repulsion that destabilizes the molecule. This stability difference is reflected
    in heats of hydrogenation: cis-2-butene releases more energy when hydrogenated
    because it starts from a higher energy state. The C=C bond strength is the same
    in both isomers.'
