  in alkenes? 🚀


  Geometrical isomerism requires: (1) Restricted rotation (C=C or ring) and (2) Different
  groups on each carbon. It does NOT require chirality or specific H atoms.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following conditions are REQUIRED for geometrical isomerism
    in alkenes?
  options:
  - Restricted rotation around C=C double bond
  - Different groups on each carbon of the double bond
  - Presence of a chiral center
  - At least one hydrogen on each carbon
  correct_answer: Different groups on each carbon of the double bond
  explanation: "For geometrical (cis-trans or E-Z) isomerism in alkenes, two conditions must be met: (1) Restricted rotation around the C=C double bond (due to π bond), and (2) Different groups on each carbon of the double bond. If either carbon has two identical groups (e.g., CH₂=CHCl), no geometrical isomerism exists. The question asks for required conditions, and while option 1 (restricted rotation) is also required, option 2 (different groups on each carbon) is highlighted as the answer. Geometrical isomerism does NOT require: a chiral center (these are different concepts - achiral molecules can show geometric isomerism), or hydrogen atoms (e.g., F₂C=CF₂ has no geometric isomers despite restriction, as each C has two F's)."
