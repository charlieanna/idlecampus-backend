  Torsional strain arises from repulsion between electrons in eclipsed bonds (0° dihedral
  angle). Steric strain is from atoms being too close. Angle strain is from deviation
  from ideal angles.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.

  question: What is the primary cause of torsional strain?
  options:
  - Repulsion between atoms that are too close in space
  - Deviation from ideal bond angles
  - Repulsion between electrons in eclipsed bonds
  - Attraction between opposite charges
  correct_answer: Repulsion between electrons in eclipsed bonds
  explanation: "Torsional strain arises from the repulsion between electrons in C-H or C-C bonds when they are eclipsed (dihedral angle = 0°). In a Newman projection, when bonds on adjacent carbons are aligned (eclipsed), the electron clouds in those bonds are closest together, causing electrostatic repulsion that raises the molecule's energy. This is minimized in staggered conformations (dihedral angle = 60°) where bonds are maximally separated. Torsional strain is different from: (1) Steric strain (van der Waals repulsion between atoms/groups that are too close in space, e.g., gauche butane), and (2) Angle strain (deviation from ideal tetrahedral/sp³ bond angles, e.g., in cyclopropane). Ethane's 12 kJ/mol rotational barrier is primarily torsional strain."
