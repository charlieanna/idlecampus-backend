  Enantiomers have identical physical properties (mp, bp, solubility, density) and
  same magnitude of optical rotation, but OPPOSITE direction of rotation.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which properties are IDENTICAL for a pair of enantiomers?
  options:
  - Melting point
  - Direction of optical rotation
  - Boiling point
  - Magnitude of optical rotation
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Magnitude of optical rotation
  explanation: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror image stereoisomers that
    have identical physical properties including melting point, boiling point, solubility,
    density, and refractive index. They also have the same magnitude (absolute value)
    of optical rotation [α]. However, they differ in the direction of optical rotation
    - one rotates plane-polarized light clockwise (+, dextrorotatory, d) while the
    other rotates it counterclockwise (-, levorotatory, l) by the same amount. For
    example, if (+)-enantiomer has [α] = +50°, the (-)-enantiomer has [α] = -50°.
    The magnitude (50°) is identical, but direction differs. All other physical properties
    listed (melting point, boiling point) are also identical.
