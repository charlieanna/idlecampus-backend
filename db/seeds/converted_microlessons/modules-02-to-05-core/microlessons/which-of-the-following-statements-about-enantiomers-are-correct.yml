  question: Which of the following statements about enantiomers are correct?
  options:
  - Only statements about mirror images and optical rotation are correct
  - Only the racemic mixture statement is correct
  - 'All statements are correct: mirror images, identical properties except rotation,
    1:1 mixture is racemic'
  - Only statements 1 and 2 are correct
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 'All statements are correct: mirror images, identical properties
    except rotation, 1:1 mixture is racemic'
  explanation: 'All the given statements about enantiomers are correct: (1) **Mirror
    images**: Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, like
    left and right hands. They have the same molecular formula and connectivity but
    opposite spatial arrangement around chiral center(s). (2) **Identical physical
    properties except optical rotation**: Enantiomers have identical melting points,
    boiling points, solubilities, densities, etc. The ONLY physical property that
    differs is optical rotation - one enantiomer rotates plane-polarized light clockwise
    (+, dextrorotatory), the other counterclockwise (-, levorotatory) by equal amounts.
    (3) **Same reactivity with achiral reagents**: Enantiomers react at identical
    rates with achiral (non-chiral) reagents because the achiral environment cannot
    distinguish between the two mirror-image forms. However, they show DIFFERENT reactivity
    with chiral reagents (like enzymes). (4) **1:1 mixture = racemic**: An equimolar
    (50:50) mixture of two enantiomers is called a racemic mixture or racemate, which
    is optically inactive because the (+) and (-) rotations cancel out.'
