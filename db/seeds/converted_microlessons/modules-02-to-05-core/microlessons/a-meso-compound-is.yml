  Meso compounds have chiral centers BUT have plane of symmetry, making them optically
  inactive (internal compensation).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'A meso compound is:'
  options:
  - Always optically active due to chiral centers
  - Has chiral centers but has a plane of symmetry
  - Always exists as a racemic mixture
  - Has no chiral centers
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Has chiral centers but has a plane of symmetry
  explanation: 'A meso compound is a fascinating stereochemical case: it contains
    chiral centers (stereocenters) but has an internal plane of symmetry that makes
    the molecule achiral overall, rendering it optically inactive. Key characteristics:
    (1) **Has chiral centers**: Contains 2 or more stereocenters (usually with R,S
    configuration), (2) **Has plane of symmetry**: An internal mirror plane divides
    the molecule into two mirror-image halves, (3) **Optically inactive**: Does NOT
    rotate plane-polarized light (rotation of one half cancels the other - internal
    compensation), (4) **NOT a racemic mixture**: It''s a single compound, not a mixture.
    Classic example: meso-tartaric acid has two chiral carbons but a plane of symmetry.
    It is optically inactive despite having chiral centers. In contrast: (+)-tartaric
    acid and (-)-tartaric acid are enantiomers (optically active), while meso-tartaric
    acid is a diastereomer of both (optically inactive). Recognition: Look for molecules
    with multiple chiral centers AND internal symmetry (plane, center, or alternating
    axis).'
