  Ethanol (alcohol) and dimethyl ether (ether) have same formula C₂H₆O but different
  functional groups. This is functional group isomerism.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Functional group isomerism
  explanation: 'Ethanol (CH₃-CH₂-OH) and dimethyl ether (CH₃-O-CH₃) are classic examples
    of functional group isomerism. They have: (1) **Same molecular formula**: Both
    have C₂H₆O, (2) **Different functional groups**: Ethanol has hydroxyl group (-OH,
    alcohol), dimethyl ether has ether linkage (C-O-C), (3) **Different properties**:
    Ethanol is liquid at room temperature (BP 78°C) due to H-bonding, dimethyl ether
    is gas (BP -24°C) with no H-bonding. This is NOT: **Chain isomerism** (same functional
    group, different carbon skeleton), **Position isomerism** (same functional group
    and skeleton, different position of group), **Metamerism** (same functional group,
    different alkyl groups on either side of functional atom - a special case of chain
    isomerism in ethers, amines). Functional group isomerism is one of the most important
    types of structural isomerism, creating compounds with drastically different chemical
    and physical properties despite identical molecular formula.'
