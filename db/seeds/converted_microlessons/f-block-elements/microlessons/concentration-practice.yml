  Froth flotation is used for sulfide ores (ZnS, PbS, CuFeS₂). Pine oil is used as
  frothing agent.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.

  question: Which concentration method is used for sulfide ores?
  options:
  - Gravity separation
  - Magnetic separation
  - Froth flotation
  - Leaching
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Froth flotation
  explanation: 'Froth flotation is the most important concentration method for sulfide
    ores such as ZnS (zinc blende), PbS (galena), CuFeS₂ (chalcopyrite), Cu₂S (chalcocite).
    The process: (1) Crushed ore is mixed with water to form slurry, (2) Frothing
    agent (pine oil, cresols) and collector (potassium ethyl xanthate) are added,
    (3) Air is blown through the mixture creating froth, (4) Sulfide ore particles
    become hydrophobic (oil-wetted) and attach to air bubbles, (5) Ore-laden froth
    floats to surface and is skimmed off, (6) Gangue (rocky impurities) is hydrophilic
    (water-wetted) and sinks. The selectivity comes from different surface chemistry
    - sulfides are non-polar while gangue is polar. Other methods: Gravity separation
    (for heavy ores like hematite), Magnetic separation (for magnetic ores like magnetite
    Fe₃O₄), Leaching (for Al, Au, Ag ores).'

  question: Which concentration method is used for magnetic ores like magnetite (Fe₃O₄)?
  options:
  - Froth flotation
  - Magnetic separation
  - Gravity separation
  - Hydraulic washing
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Magnetic separation
  explanation: 'Magnetic separation is used for ores containing magnetic components.
    The crushed ore is passed over a conveyor belt with an electromagnetic separator.
    Magnetic particles (like magnetite Fe₃O₄) are attracted and separated from non-magnetic
    gangue. Examples: (1) Magnetite (Fe₃O₄) - strongly magnetic, (2) Pyrolusite (MnO₂)
    - weakly magnetic, (3) Hematite (Fe₂O₃) - weakly magnetic. This method is efficient,
    clean, and doesn''t require water. Other magnetic ores: Chromite (FeCr₂O₄), Ilmenite
    (FeTiO₃). Non-magnetic ores use other methods: Froth flotation for sulfides,
    Gravity separation for heavy ores.'

  question: What is the role of collectors in froth flotation process?
  options:
  - To create foam on the surface
  - To make ore particles water-repellent
  - To dissolve gangue particles
  - To increase density of ore
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: To make ore particles water-repellent
  explanation: 'Collectors (like potassium ethyl xanthate, pine oil) make the ore
    particles hydrophobic (water-repellent/oil-wetted) so they attach to air bubbles
    and float. The mechanism: Collector molecules have two parts - (1) Polar head
    group that attaches to ore particle surface, (2) Non-polar tail that extends into
    water making particle hydrophobic. The hydrophobic ore particles preferentially
    attach to air bubbles and rise with the froth, while hydrophilic gangue sinks.
    Different types of reagents: Collectors (potassium xanthate), Frothers (pine
    oil, cresols - stabilize foam), Activators (CuSO₄ - activate sphalerite ZnS),
    Depressants (NaCN - depress ZnS when separating from PbS).'
