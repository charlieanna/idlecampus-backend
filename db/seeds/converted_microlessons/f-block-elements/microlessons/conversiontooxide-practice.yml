  Roasting: heating in excess air (converts S to O). Calcination: heating in limited/no
  air (removes CO₂, H₂O).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the difference between roasting and calcination?
  options:
  - 'Roasting: heating in excess air (for sulfides); Calcination: heating in limited
    air (for carbonates/hydrates)'
  - 'Roasting: heating for oxides; Calcination: heating for sulfides'
  - Both are identical processes with different names
  - Roasting uses flux; Calcination does not use flux
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 'Roasting: heating in excess air (for sulfides); Calcination: heating
    in limited air (for carbonates/hydrates)'
  explanation: 'Roasting and calcination are both thermal treatment processes but
    differ in air supply and purpose: **Roasting** = Heating ore in excess air/oxygen.
    Used for sulfide ores to convert them to oxides. The sulfur is oxidized to SO₂
    and driven off. Example: 2ZnS + 3O₂ → 2ZnO + 2SO₂ (exothermic), 2Cu₂S + 3O₂ →
    2Cu₂O + 2SO₂, 2PbS + 3O₂ → 2PbO + 2SO₂. **Calcination** = Heating ore in limited
    or absent air. Used for carbonate and hydrated ores to remove volatile impurities
    like CO₂ and H₂O. Examples: ZnCO₃ → ZnO + CO₂ (endothermic), CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂
    (limestone to quicklime), Al₂O₃·2H₂O → Al₂O₃ + 2H₂O (bauxite). The key difference:
    roasting requires oxygen for oxidation of sulfur, calcination requires limited
    air to prevent oxidation while removing volatiles.'

  question: Which process is used to convert zinc carbonate ore (calamine) to zinc
    oxide?
  options:
  - Roasting
  - Calcination
  - Smelting
  - Leaching
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Calcination
  explanation: 'Calcination is used to convert zinc carbonate (ZnCO₃, calamine) to
    zinc oxide (ZnO). The ore is heated strongly in limited air below its melting
    point: ZnCO₃ → ZnO + CO₂↑ (endothermic reaction). The CO₂ gas escapes, leaving
    behind zinc oxide. This is NOT roasting because: (1) No oxygen/air is needed
    for the reaction, (2) The process removes CO₂, not SO₂, (3) It''s endothermic,
    not exothermic. Other calcination examples: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ (limestone to quicklime),
    MgCO₃ → MgO + CO₂, Al₂O₃·2H₂O → Al₂O₃ + 2H₂O (removing water from bauxite). After
    calcination, ZnO is reduced to Zn metal using carbon.'

  question: What is the main product released during roasting of zinc sulfide (ZnS)?
  options:
  - CO₂
  - H₂O
  - SO₂
  - H₂S
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: SO₂
  explanation: 'During roasting of zinc sulfide (zinc blende, ZnS), sulfur dioxide
    (SO₂) is the main gaseous product released: 2ZnS + 3O₂ → 2ZnO + 2SO₂↑ (exothermic).
    The ore is heated strongly in excess air/oxygen. The sulfur in ZnS is oxidized
    to SO₂ which escapes as a gas. The ZnO formed is then reduced to metallic Zn
    using carbon (coke) in a blast furnace: ZnO + C → Zn + CO. Other sulfide roasting
    reactions: 2Cu₂S + 3O₂ → 2Cu₂O + 2SO₂, 2PbS + 3O₂ → 2PbO + 2SO₂. Environmental
    concern: SO₂ is an air pollutant causing acid rain, so modern smelters capture
    it to produce H₂SO₄.'
