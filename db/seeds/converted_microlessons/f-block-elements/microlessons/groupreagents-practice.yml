  question: Which group reagent is used for Group I cations?
  options:
  - Dilute HCl
  - H₂S in acidic medium
  - NH₄OH + NH₄Cl
  - (NH₄)₂CO₃
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Dilute HCl
  explanation: 'Dilute HCl is the group reagent for Group I cations. It precipitates
    Pb²⁺, Ag⁺, and Hg₂²⁺ as white chlorides: PbCl₂ (white, soluble in hot water),
    AgCl (white, curdy), Hg₂Cl₂ (white, calomel). These are the only common cations
    that form insoluble chlorides in cold dilute HCl. The precipitation must be done
    in cold conditions to ensure complete precipitation of PbCl₂, which becomes more
    soluble in hot water.'

  question: What is the group reagent for Group II cations?
  options:
  - Dilute HCl
  - H₂S in acidic medium (dilute HCl)
  - NH₄OH in presence of NH₄Cl
  - H₂S in basic medium
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: H₂S in acidic medium (dilute HCl)
  explanation: 'H₂S (hydrogen sulfide) in acidic medium (dilute HCl) is the group
    reagent for Group II cations. It precipitates Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, Cd²⁺, Bi³⁺, Hg²⁺, As³⁺,
    Sb³⁺, Sn²⁺/Sn⁴⁺ as sulfides: CuS (black), PbS (black), CdS (yellow), Bi₂S₃ (brown),
    HgS (black), As₂S₃ (yellow), Sb₂S₃ (orange), SnS (brown). These sulfides have
    very low Ksp values and precipitate even in acidic conditions. The acidic medium
    (low OH⁻ concentration) prevents precipitation of Group III and IV sulfides/hydroxides.'

  question: Which cations are precipitated by (NH₄)₂CO₃ in Group V?
  options:
  - Ba²⁺, Sr²⁺, Ca²⁺
  - Mg²⁺, NH₄⁺, Na⁺, K⁺
  - Al³⁺, Fe³⁺, Cr³⁺
  - Zn²⁺, Ni²⁺, Co²⁺
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Ba²⁺, Sr²⁺, Ca²⁺
  explanation: 'Ammonium carbonate (NH₄)₂CO₃ is the group reagent for Group V cations.
    It precipitates Ba²⁺, Sr²⁺, and Ca²⁺ as white carbonates: BaCO₃ (white), SrCO₃
    (white), CaCO₃ (white). These alkaline earth metal carbonates are insoluble in
    water but dissolve in dilute acids. Group VI cations (Mg²⁺, NH₄⁺, Na⁺, K⁺) remain
    in solution and are identified separately. The precipitation is done in presence
    of NH₄Cl and NH₄OH to maintain proper pH and prevent co-precipitation.'
