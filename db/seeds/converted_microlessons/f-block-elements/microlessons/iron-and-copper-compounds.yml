    question: "When ferrous sulfate (FeSO₄) solution is treated with concentrated H₂SO₄ followed by careful addition of freshly prepared FeSO₄ solution, a brown ring forms at the junction. This brown ring test detects which ion?"
    options:
      - "Sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻)"
      - "Nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)"
      - "Ferric ion (Fe³⁺)"
      - "Hydroxide ion (OH⁻)"
    correct_answer: "Nitrate ion (NO₃⁻)"
    explanation: "The brown ring test is a classic qualitative test for detecting nitrate ions (NO₃⁻) in solution. The test involves two steps: First, concentrated H₂SO₄ is added to the test solution containing nitrate ions. Then, freshly prepared ferrous sulfate (FeSO₄) solution is carefully added along the sides of the test tube so it forms a layer below the concentrated acid. At the junction of these two layers, a brown ring forms. The chemistry involves: In the acidic medium, nitrate ions are reduced to nitric oxide (NO) by Fe²⁺: NO₃⁻ + 3Fe²⁺ + 4H⁺ → NO + 3Fe³⁺ + 2H₂O. The nitric oxide immediately forms a brown complex with excess Fe²⁺ ions: Fe²⁺ + NO → [Fe(H₂O)₅(NO)]²⁺ (brown color). This brown complex, called ferrous nitroso complex or nitrosoferrous complex, is the characteristic brown ring. The test must be performed carefully: (1) Use freshly prepared FeSO₄ to ensure Fe²⁺ hasn't oxidized to Fe³⁺. (2) Add solutions gently to maintain distinct layers. (3) The brown color appears specifically at the interface. This test is highly sensitive and commonly used in qualitative analysis to confirm presence of nitrates in salts, soil, and water samples."

    question: "What is the composition and IUPAC name of the deep blue complex formed when excess ammonia is added to copper sulfate solution?"
    options:
      - "[Cu(H₂O)₆]²⁺, hexaaquacopper(II) ion"
      - "[Cu(NH₃)₄(H₂O)₂]²⁺, tetraammineaquacopper(II) ion"
      - "[Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺, tetraamminecopper(II) ion"
      - "[Cu(OH)₄]²⁻, tetrahydroxocuprate(II) ion"
    correct_answer: "[Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺, tetraamminecopper(II) ion"
    explanation: "When excess ammonia is added to copper sulfate solution, a characteristic color change occurs that is important for copper ion detection. Initially, when a small amount of ammonia is added to the pale blue CuSO₄ solution, a precipitate of Cu(OH)₂ forms (light blue): Cu²⁺ + 2NH₃ + 2H₂O → Cu(OH)₂ + 2NH₄⁺. However, when excess ammonia is added, this precipitate dissolves to form an intensely deep blue solution. The deep blue color is due to the formation of tetraamminecopper(II) complex: Cu(OH)₂ + 4NH₃ → [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ + 2OH⁻. Or directly: Cu²⁺ + 4NH₃ → [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺. This complex has a square planar geometry with four ammonia molecules coordinated to the central Cu²⁺ ion through their lone pairs of electrons (acting as Lewis bases). The IUPAC name is tetraamminecopper(II) ion. The deep blue color is much more intense than the pale blue of the aqua complex [Cu(H₂O)₆]²⁺ because the ammonia ligands cause a greater crystal field splitting, resulting in absorption of light in the orange-red region and transmission of the complementary deep blue color. This reaction is used as a confirmatory test for Cu²⁺ ions in qualitative analysis."
