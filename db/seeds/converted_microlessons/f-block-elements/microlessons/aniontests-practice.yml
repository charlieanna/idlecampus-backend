  Brown ring test detects NO₃⁻. FeSO₄ + H₂SO₄ + NO₃⁻ → [Fe(H₂O)₅(NO)]²⁺ (brown ring).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: The brown ring test is used to detect which anion?
  options:
  - Chloride (Cl⁻)
  - Sulfate (SO₄²⁻)
  - Nitrate (NO₃⁻)
  - Carbonate (CO₃²⁻)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Nitrate (NO₃⁻)
  explanation: 'The brown ring test is a confirmatory test for nitrate ions (NO₃⁻).
    Procedure: (1) Add freshly prepared FeSO₄ solution to the test solution containing
    nitrate, (2) Carefully add concentrated H₂SO₄ along the sides of the test tube
    to form a layer, (3) A brown ring forms at the junction of the two liquids. The
    chemistry: FeSO₄ + NO₃⁻ + H₂SO₄ → [Fe(H₂O)₅(NO)]²⁺ (brown colored nitroso ferrous
    sulfate complex) + other products. The brown color is due to the formation of
    pentaaquanitrosyliron(II) complex. The test must be done carefully as the ring
    disappears on shaking or heating.'

  question: Which reagent is used to test for sulfate ions?
  options:
  - Silver nitrate solution
  - Barium chloride solution
  - Lead acetate solution
  - Sodium hydroxide solution
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Barium chloride solution
  explanation: 'Barium chloride (BaCl₂) solution is used to test for sulfate (SO₄²⁻)
    ions. When BaCl₂ is added to a solution containing sulfate ions, a white precipitate
    of barium sulfate (BaSO₄) forms: Ba²⁺ + SO₄²⁻ → BaSO₄↓ (white ppt). The precipitate
    is insoluble in dilute HCl, which distinguishes it from other white precipitates.
    Alternative test: Lead acetate also gives white precipitate with sulfate, but
    BaCl₂ is preferred. Silver nitrate tests for halides (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻), not sulfate.'

  question: What color precipitate indicates the presence of chloride ions when silver
    nitrate is added?
  options:
  - Yellow precipitate
  - White precipitate
  - Brown precipitate
  - No precipitate forms
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: White precipitate
  explanation: 'When silver nitrate (AgNO₃) solution is added to a solution containing
    chloride ions (Cl⁻), a white precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl) forms: Ag⁺
    + Cl⁻ → AgCl↓ (white). The precipitate is: (1) Curdy white in appearance, (2)
    Insoluble in dilute HNO₃, (3) Soluble in ammonia solution forming [Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺
    complex. This test distinguishes halides: Cl⁻ gives white AgCl, Br⁻ gives pale
    yellow AgBr, I⁻ gives yellow AgI. The test is done in acidic medium (dilute HNO₃)
    to prevent interference from other anions like carbonate or sulfide.'
