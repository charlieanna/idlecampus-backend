  TRUE. All actinoids are radioactive. Elements after uranium (93+) are synthetic
  and highly radioactive.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.

  question: Which statement about actinoids is correct?
  options:
  - All actinoids are naturally occurring elements
  - All actinoids are radioactive
  - All actinoids have stable isotopes
  - Actinoids are found in group 3 of periodic table
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: All actinoids are radioactive
  explanation: 'All actinoid elements (atomic numbers 89-103) are radioactive. The first
    few actinoids (Th, Pa, U) occur naturally, but elements after uranium (Np, Pu,
    Am, etc.) are synthetic and highly radioactive with short half-lives. Even naturally
    occurring actinoids like uranium-238 and thorium-232 are radioactive, though they
    have very long half-lives (4.5 billion years for U-238). The radioactivity stems
    from nuclear instability due to the large number of protons and neutrons.'

  question: How many elements are there in the actinoid series?
  options:
  - '12'
  - '14'
  - '15'
  - '16'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '15'
  explanation: 'The actinoid series consists of 15 elements from actinium (Ac, Z=89)
    to lawrencium (Lr, Z=103). They correspond to the filling of 5f orbitals. The
    series includes: Ac, Th, Pa, U, Np, Pu, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, Md, No, and Lr.
    Only the first four (Ac, Th, Pa, U) occur naturally in significant amounts; all
    elements after uranium are synthetic. Note: Sometimes actinium is excluded and
    the series is considered 14 elements (Th to Lr), analogous to the 14 lanthanoids.'

  question: Which actinoid element is used as fuel in nuclear reactors?
  options:
  - Thorium-232
  - Uranium-235
  - Plutonium-238
  - Americium-241
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Uranium-235
  explanation: 'Uranium-235 (U-235) is the primary fuel used in nuclear reactors because
    it is fissile - it can sustain a nuclear chain reaction when struck by thermal
    (slow) neutrons. When U-235 absorbs a neutron, it becomes unstable U-236 which
    splits (fissions) into smaller nuclei, releasing energy and 2-3 more neutrons
    that can cause further fissions. Natural uranium contains only 0.7% U-235 (rest
    is U-238), so it must be enriched to 3-5% U-235 for reactor use. Plutonium-239
    (not listed) is also used as reactor fuel and in nuclear weapons. Thorium-232
    is fertile (can be converted to fissile U-233) but not directly fissile.'
