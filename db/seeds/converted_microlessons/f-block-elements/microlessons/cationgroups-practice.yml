  Group II: Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, Cd²⁺, Bi³⁺, etc. (precipitate as sulfides in acidic H₂S).
  Ag⁺ is Group I, Zn²⁺ is Group IV.


  ## Key Points

  question: Which cations belong to Group II in qualitative analysis?
  options:
  - Pb²⁺, Ag⁺, Hg₂²⁺
  - Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, Cd²⁺, Bi³⁺
  - Al³⁺, Fe³⁺, Cr³⁺
  - Zn²⁺, Ni²⁺, Co²⁺, Mn²⁺
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, Cd²⁺, Bi³⁺
  explanation: 'Group II cations are precipitated as sulfides in acidic medium (dilute
    HCl + H₂S). Members include: Cu²⁺, Pb²⁺, Cd²⁺, Bi³⁺, Hg²⁺, As³⁺, Sb³⁺, Sn²⁺/Sn⁴⁺.
    These sulfides (CuS, PbS, CdS, Bi₂S₃, HgS) are insoluble even in acidic conditions
    due to very low Ksp values. Group I (Pb²⁺, Ag⁺, Hg₂²⁺) precipitates as chlorides
    with dilute HCl. Group III (Al³⁺, Fe³⁺, Cr³⁺) precipitates as hydroxides in basic
    medium. Group IV (Zn²⁺, Ni²⁺, Co²⁺, Mn²⁺) precipitates as sulfides in basic medium.
    Note: Pb²⁺ appears in both Group I (as PbCl₂) and Group II (as PbS).'

  question: What is the group reagent for Group I cations?
  options:
  - Dilute HCl
  - H₂S in acidic medium
  - NH₄OH + NH₄Cl
  - H₂S in basic medium
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Dilute HCl
  explanation: 'Dilute HCl (hydrochloric acid) is the group reagent for Group I cations.
    When added to a solution containing Group I cations, it precipitates three cations
    as white chlorides: Pb²⁺ → PbCl₂ (white, soluble in hot water), Ag⁺ → AgCl (white,
    curdy), Hg₂²⁺ → Hg₂Cl₂ (white). These are the only common metal chlorides insoluble
    in cold water. The precipitation is done in acidic medium to prevent hydrolysis.
    Other group reagents: Group II = H₂S in dilute HCl (acidic), Group III = NH₄OH
    + NH₄Cl (basic), Group IV = H₂S in basic medium, Group V = (NH₄)₂CO₃.'

  question: Which group of cations is precipitated using NH₄OH in presence of NH₄Cl?
  options:
  - Group I
  - Group II
  - Group III
  - Group IV
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Group III
  explanation: 'Group III cations are precipitated using NH₄OH (ammonium hydroxide)
    in presence of NH₄Cl. The cations include: Fe³⁺, Al³⁺, Cr³⁺. They precipitate
    as hydroxides: Fe³⁺ → Fe(OH)₃ (reddish brown gelatinous ppt), Al³⁺ → Al(OH)₃
    (white gelatinous ppt), Cr³⁺ → Cr(OH)₃ (green gelatinous ppt). NH₄Cl is added
    to prevent precipitation of Group IV cations by suppressing hydroxide ion concentration
    through common ion effect (NH₄Cl ⇌ NH₄⁺ + Cl⁻ shifts NH₄OH ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻ equilibrium
    to left). The precipitation is done after removing Groups I and II.'
