  question: What is the most common oxidation state of lanthanoids?
  options:
  - '+2'
  - '+3'
  - '+4'
  - '+5'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '+3'
  explanation: 'The most common oxidation state of lanthanoids (lanthanides) is +3,
    forming Ln³⁺ ions in compounds. This arises from loss of two 6s electrons and
    one 4f or 5d electron. The +3 state is predominant across the entire lanthanoid
    series (La to Lu) due to: (1) Similar energy required to remove the third electron,
    (2) Stability achieved in +3 state despite no special electronic configuration,
    (3) 4f orbitals being inner orbitals, not significantly participating in bonding.
    **Notable exceptions to +3 rule**: Ce⁴⁺ (empty f⁰ configuration like [Xe]), Eu²⁺
    (half-filled f⁷ configuration, especially stable), Yb²⁺ (filled f¹⁴ configuration),
    Tb⁴⁺ (half-filled f⁷ configuration). The lanthanoid contraction (gradual decrease
    in atomic/ionic radii) occurs across the series but doesn''t change the preferred
    +3 state. This contrasts with actinoids which show variable oxidation states from
    +3 to +7.'

  question: Which lanthanoid ion is exceptionally stable in +4 oxidation state?
  options:
  - Europium (Eu⁴⁺)
  - Cerium (Ce⁴⁺)
  - Ytterbium (Yb⁴⁺)
  - Terbium (Tb⁴⁺)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Cerium (Ce⁴⁺)
  explanation: 'Cerium (Ce⁴⁺) is exceptionally stable in +4 oxidation state because
    it achieves the noble gas configuration [Xe] with empty 4f orbitals (4f⁰). Ce
    readily loses all four valence electrons: Ce ([Xe]4f¹5d¹6s²) → Ce⁴⁺ ([Xe]). This
    is more stable than Ce³⁺ which has 4f¹ configuration. Ce⁴⁺ is a strong oxidizing
    agent and commonly found in compounds like CeO₂ (ceria) and (NH₄)₂Ce(NO₃)₆ (ceric
    ammonium nitrate). Other exceptions: Tb can also show +4 (Tb⁴⁺ has 4f⁷ half-filled),
    but Ce⁴⁺ is the most common and stable +4 lanthanoid ion.'

  question: Why are Eu²⁺ and Yb²⁺ relatively stable compared to other lanthanoid
    +2 ions?
  options:
  - They have completely filled 4f orbitals
  - Eu²⁺ has half-filled 4f⁷ and Yb²⁺ has filled 4f¹⁴ configuration
  - They have the smallest atomic radius
  - They have the highest ionization energy
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Eu²⁺ has half-filled 4f⁷ and Yb²⁺ has filled 4f¹⁴ configuration
  explanation: 'Eu²⁺ and Yb²⁺ are relatively stable in +2 oxidation state because
    they achieve particularly stable electronic configurations: Eu²⁺ ([Xe]4f⁷) has
    half-filled 4f orbitals - extra stability from exchange energy, Yb²⁺ ([Xe]4f¹⁴)
    has completely filled 4f orbitals - maximum stability. These configurations are
    analogous to Mn²⁺ (3d⁵, half-filled) and Zn²⁺ (3d¹⁰, filled) in 3d series. Half-filled
    and fully-filled subshells are especially stable due to symmetry and exchange
    energy. While other lanthanoids can form +2 state in special conditions, Eu²⁺
    and Yb²⁺ are stable enough to exist in aqueous solutions and common compounds.'
