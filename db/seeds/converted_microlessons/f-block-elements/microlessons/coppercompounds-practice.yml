  [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ complex is deep blue (tetraamminecopper(II) ion). Formed when Cu(OH)₂
  dissolves in excess NH₃.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the color of the [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ complex?
  options:
  - Light blue
  - Deep blue
  - Green
  - Purple
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Deep blue
  explanation: 'The tetraamminecopper(II) complex [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ has a characteristic
    deep blue (or intense blue) color. Formation: When excess ammonia is added to
    copper(II) hydroxide or copper(II) sulfate solution: Cu(OH)₂ + 4NH₃ → [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺
    + 2OH⁻ (dissolves blue ppt), or CuSO₄ + 4NH₃ → [Cu(NH₃)₄]SO₄ (deep blue solution).
    The complex is square planar in geometry. The deep blue color is more intense
    than the pale blue of aqueous Cu²⁺ ions [Cu(H₂O)₆]²⁺. This reaction is used as
    a test for Cu²⁺ ions - pale blue solution turns deep blue with excess NH₃.'

  question: Which copper compound is formed when Cu²⁺ reacts with potassium ferrocyanide?
  options:
  - Copper(II) chloride (green)
  - Copper(II) ferrocyanide (reddish brown)
  - Copper(II) sulfate (blue)
  - Copper(II) oxide (black)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Copper(II) ferrocyanide (reddish brown)
  explanation: 'When Cu²⁺ ions react with potassium ferrocyanide K₄[Fe(CN)₆], a reddish-brown
    precipitate of copper(II) ferrocyanide forms: 2Cu²⁺ + [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ → Cu₂[Fe(CN)₆]↓
    (reddish brown ppt). This is a confirmatory test for Cu²⁺ ions. The precipitate
    is also called cupric ferrocyanide. Note the difference: Fe³⁺ gives blue precipitate
    with K₄[Fe(CN)₆] (Prussian blue), while Cu²⁺ gives reddish-brown precipitate.
    Other Cu²⁺ tests: Deep blue with excess NH₃, chocolate brown ppt with K₄[Fe(CN)₆].'

  question: What happens when hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) is passed through acidified
    copper sulfate solution?
  options:
  - White precipitate of CuS forms
  - Black precipitate of CuS forms
  - Blue precipitate of Cu(OH)₂ forms
  - No reaction occurs
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Black precipitate of CuS forms
  explanation: 'When H₂S gas is passed through acidified copper sulfate (CuSO₄) solution,
    a black precipitate of copper(II) sulfide (CuS) forms: Cu²⁺ + H₂S → CuS↓ (black)
    + 2H⁺. CuS is one of the most insoluble sulfides (very low Ksp ≈ 10⁻³⁶), so it
    precipitates even in acidic medium. This is characteristic of Group II cations
    in qualitative analysis. The black color of CuS is distinctive. Other metal sulfides:
    PbS (black), CdS (yellow), Bi₂S₃ (brown), ZnS (white/pale yellow), FeS (black).
    The precipitation is used to separate Cu²⁺ from other cations.'
