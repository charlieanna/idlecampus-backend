  question: Which refining process is used to obtain ultra-pure nickel?
  options:
  - Van Arkel method
  - Mond process
  - Zone refining
  - Electrolytic refining
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Mond process
  explanation: 'The Mond process is used to refine nickel to highest purity (>99.9%).
    Steps: (1) Impure nickel is heated with CO at 50-60°C forming volatile nickel
    tetracarbonyl: Ni + 4CO → Ni(CO)₄ (volatile, colorless gas, b.p. 43°C), (2) The
    Ni(CO)₄ vapor is separated from impurities, (3) Pure Ni(CO)₄ is heated to 150-200°C
    where it decomposes: Ni(CO)₄ → Ni (pure) + 4CO↑. The CO is recycled. This is
    a vapour phase refining method. The process is named after Ludwig Mond who developed
    it in 1890. Other metals cannot form stable, volatile carbonyls under these conditions,
    ensuring high purity nickel.'

  question: Which refining method is used for purifying titanium and zirconium?
  options:
  - Mond process
  - Van Arkel method
  - Parkes process
  - Cupellation
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Van Arkel method
  explanation: 'The Van Arkel method (also called Van Arkel-de Boer process) is used
    to refine titanium and zirconium to ultra-high purity. Process: (1) Impure metal
    is heated with iodine at ~250°C forming volatile iodide: Ti + 2I₂ → TiI₄ (volatile),
    Zr + 2I₂ → ZrI₄ (volatile), (2) The volatile iodide vapor passes over a heated
    tungsten filament at ~1400°C, (3) The iodide decomposes on the hot filament depositing
    pure metal: TiI₄ → Ti (pure) + 2I₂↑. The iodine is recycled. This vapour phase
    refining method produces metals of exceptional purity (>99.99%) required for semiconductor
    and aerospace applications.'

  question: Which refining method involves passing electric current through an electrolyte
    to obtain pure metal?
  options:
  - Zone refining
  - Vapour phase refining
  - Electrolytic refining
  - Liquation
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Electrolytic refining
  explanation: 'Electrolytic refining uses electrolysis to purify metals. Setup: Impure
    metal is made the anode, pure metal strip is the cathode, and a metal salt solution
    is the electrolyte. Process: When current passes, metal from impure anode dissolves
    as ions and deposits as pure metal at cathode. Impurities either remain in solution
    or settle as anode mud. Examples: Copper refining uses CuSO₄ + H₂SO₄ electrolyte
    - At anode: Cu → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ (impure Cu dissolves), At cathode: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ →
    Cu (pure Cu deposits). Precious metals like Au, Ag collect as anode mud. Other
    metals refined: Ag, Au, Zn, Al, Ni. Advantage: High purity (>99.9%), commercial
    scale, recovers valuable impurities.'
