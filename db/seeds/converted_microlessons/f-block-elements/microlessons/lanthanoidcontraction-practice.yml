  Lanthanoid contraction is the steady decrease in size from La³⁺ to Lu³⁺ due to poor
  shielding by 4f electrons.


  ## Key Points

  question: What is lanthanoid contraction?
  options:
  - Increase in atomic size from La to Lu
  - Steady decrease in atomic and ionic radii from La to Lu
  - Variation in oxidation states across lanthanoids
  - Decrease in magnetic properties from La to Lu
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Steady decrease in atomic and ionic radii from La to Lu
  explanation: 'Lanthanoid contraction is the steady decrease in atomic and ionic
    radii from lanthanum (La) to lutetium (Lu) across the lanthanoid series. Cause:
    As we move across the series, electrons are added to 4f orbitals which have poor
    shielding effect. The increasing nuclear charge is not effectively shielded by
    4f electrons, causing the outer electrons to be pulled closer to the nucleus.
    Result: Each successive lanthanoid has slightly smaller radius than the previous
    one, despite having one more electron. The total contraction from La³⁺ to Lu³⁺
    is about 0.2 Å (from 1.06 to 0.85 Å).'

  question: What is the main consequence of lanthanoid contraction?
  options:
  - Third row d-block elements have similar size to second row d-block elements
  - All lanthanoids have the same atomic radius
  - Lanthanoids show variable oxidation states
  - Lanthanoids are highly radioactive
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Third row d-block elements have similar size to second row d-block
    elements
  explanation: 'The most important consequence of lanthanoid contraction is that third
    row (5d series) transition elements have almost the same atomic radii as their
    second row (4d series) counterparts. Examples: Zr (160 pm) ≈ Hf (159 pm), Nb
    (146 pm) ≈ Ta (146 pm), Mo (139 pm) ≈ W (139 pm). This happens because the lanthanoid
    contraction exactly compensates for the normal size increase expected when going
    to a higher period. As a result, elements like Zr and Hf have very similar properties
    and are difficult to separate. Other consequences: Similar basicities of lanthanoid
    hydroxides, variation in stability of complexes.'

  question: Why do 4f electrons cause poor shielding in lanthanoids?
  options:
  - 4f orbitals are too small to hold electrons
  - 4f orbitals have diffuse shape extending far from nucleus
  - 4f orbitals are deeply buried and have limited radial extension
  - 4f orbitals are not occupied in lanthanoids
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 4f orbitals are deeply buried and have limited radial extension
  explanation: '4f electrons provide poor shielding because 4f orbitals are deeply
    buried inside the atom and have limited radial extension (they don''t extend far
    from the nucleus). Unlike s and p orbitals which have significant electron density
    near the nucleus, f orbitals have most of their electron density in the inner
    regions. When 4f electrons are added across the lanthanoid series, they cannot
    effectively shield the outer 5s, 5p, and 6s electrons from the increasing nuclear
    charge. This poor shielding allows the nucleus to attract outer electrons more
    strongly, causing atomic/ionic radius to decrease progressively across the series.'
