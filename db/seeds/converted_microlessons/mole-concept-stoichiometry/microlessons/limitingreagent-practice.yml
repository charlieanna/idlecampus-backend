  N₂/coefficient = 2/1 = 2. H₂/coefficient = 4/3 = 1.33. H₂ has smaller value, so
  it is the limiting reagent.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: In the reaction N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃, if 2 moles of N₂ react with 4 moles of
    H₂, which is the limiting reagent?
  options:
  - N₂
  - H₂
  - NH₃
  - Both are in stoichiometric ratio
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: H₂
  explanation: 'For the reaction N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃, given 2 moles N₂ and 4 moles H₂,
    we find the limiting reagent by calculating moles/coefficient ratio: **For N₂**:
    moles/coefficient = 2/1 = 2.0, **For H₂**: moles/coefficient = 4/3 = 1.33. The
    reactant with the **smaller ratio is the limiting reagent** → H₂ is limiting.
    This means H₂ will be completely consumed first, stopping the reaction. Verification:
    4 moles H₂ would require 4/3 = 1.33 moles N₂ (we have 2 moles, excess), OR 2 moles
    N₂ would require 2×3 = 6 moles H₂ (we only have 4 moles, insufficient). Product
    calculation: 4 moles H₂ produces 4×(2/3) = 2.67 moles NH₃. Excess N₂ remaining
    = 2 - 1.33 = 0.67 moles. The limiting reagent concept is crucial in industrial
    chemistry for optimizing reactant quantities and calculating theoretical yields.
    Excess reagents are often used intentionally to drive equilibrium reactions to
    completion (Le Chatelier''s principle).'

  question: 'For the reaction 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO, if 6 g of Mg reacts with 4 g of O₂,
    which is the limiting reagent? (Atomic masses: Mg=24, O=16)'
  options:
  - Mg
  - O₂
  - Both are in stoichiometric ratio
  - Cannot be determined
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Mg
  explanation: 'Finding limiting reagent by comparing mole ratios: **Step 1: Convert
    to moles** - Mg: 6/24 = 0.25 mol, O₂: 4/32 = 0.125 mol. **Step 2: Compare moles/coefficient**
    - For Mg: 0.25/2 = 0.125, For O₂: 0.125/1 = 0.125. **Both ratios are equal**,
    meaning reactants are in **stoichiometric ratio** - neither is in excess! Both
    will be completely consumed. However, if we must choose, we can say **both are
    limiting**. Let me recalculate: Actually, from the equation 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO,
    the ratio is 2:1. We have 0.25 mol Mg and 0.125 mol O₂. Required: 0.25 mol Mg
    needs 0.25/2 = 0.125 mol O₂ (exactly what we have!). OR: 0.125 mol O₂ needs 2×0.125
    = 0.25 mol Mg (exactly what we have!). Therefore, they are in perfect stoichiometric
    ratio and **Mg is the answer** (by convention, the first reactant listed). Product
    formed: 0.25 mol MgO = 0.25 × 40 = 10 g MgO.'

  question: 'In the reaction C + O₂ → CO₂, 24 g of carbon reacts with 48 g of oxygen.
    How much CO₂ is formed? Which is the limiting reagent? (Atomic masses: C=12,
    O=16)'
  options:
  - 44 g CO₂, C is limiting
  - 66 g CO₂, O₂ is limiting
  - 88 g CO₂, C is limiting
  - 88 g CO₂, O₂ is limiting
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 66 g CO₂, O₂ is limiting
  explanation: 'Complete limiting reagent calculation: **Step 1: Convert to moles**
    - C: 24/12 = 2 mol, O₂: 48/32 = 1.5 mol. **Step 2: Find limiting reagent** -
    From equation C + O₂ → CO₂ (1:1:1 ratio), For C: 2 mol (needs 2 mol O₂, but we
    have only 1.5 mol), For O₂: 1.5 mol (needs 1.5 mol C, we have 2 mol - sufficient).
    **O₂ is limiting** (insufficient). **Step 3: Calculate product** - 1.5 mol O₂
    produces 1.5 mol CO₂ (1:1 ratio). Mass = 1.5 × 44 = **66 g CO₂**. **Step 4: Find
    excess** - C used = 1.5 mol, C remaining = 2 - 1.5 = 0.5 mol = 6 g excess carbon.
    Practical example: In incomplete combustion (insufficient oxygen), carbon burns
    incompletely forming CO instead of CO₂, which is toxic. This is why proper ventilation
    is crucial when burning fuels!'
