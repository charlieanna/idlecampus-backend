  \ Stoichiometry & Limiting Reagent\n\n    ## Stoichiometry\n\n    **Stoichiometry**\
  \ is the quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a chemical\
  \ reaction.\n\n    ### Law of Conservation of Mass\n\n    **Mass of reactants =\
  \ Mass of products**\n\n    In a balanced equation, the number of atoms of each\
  \ element is the same on both sides.\n\n    ## Balanced Chemical Equations\n\n \
  \   ### Example: Combustion of Methane\n\n    **CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O**\n\n   \
  \ **Interpretation:**\n    - 1 mole CH₄ reacts with 2 moles O₂\n    - Produces 1\
  \ mole CO₂ and 2 moles H₂O\n    - 16 g CH₄ + 64 g O₂ → 44 g CO₂ + 36 g H₂O\n   \
  \ - 1 molecule CH₄ + 2 molecules O₂ → 1 molecule CO₂ + 2 molecules H₂O\n\n    ##\
  \ Stoichiometric Calculations\n\n    ### Type 1: Mass-Mass Calculations\n\n    **Example:\
  \ How many grams of CO₂ are produced from 10 g of CH₄?**\n\n    **CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂\
  \ + 2H₂O**\n\n    Solution:\n    1. Moles of CH₄ = 10/16 = 0.625 mol\n    2. From\
  \ equation: 1 mol CH₄ → 1 mol CO₂\n    3. Moles of CO₂ = 0.625 mol\n    4. Mass\
  \ of CO₂ = 0.625 × 44 = 27.5 g\n\n    **Answer: 27.5 g CO₂**\n\n    ### Type 2:\
  \ Mass-Volume Calculations\n\n    **Example: What volume of O₂ at STP is required\
  \ to burn 8 g of CH₄?**\n\n    **CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O**\n\n    Solution:\n   \
  \ 1. Moles of CH₄ = 8/16 = 0.5 mol\n    2. From equation: 1 mol CH₄ requires 2 mol\
  \ O₂\n    3. Moles of O₂ = 2 × 0.5 = 1 mol\n    4. Volume of O₂ = 1 × 22.4 = 22.4\
  \ L\n\n    **Answer: 22.4 L O₂**\n\n    ## Limiting Reagent\n\n    **Limiting reagent**\
  \ = Reactant that is completely consumed first and limits product formation\n\n\
  \    **Excess reagent** = Reactant that remains after reaction is complete\n\n \
  \   ### How to Identify Limiting Reagent\n\n    **Method 1: Mole Ratio Method**\n\
  \    1. Calculate moles of each reactant\n    2. Divide moles by stoichiometric\
  \ coefficient\n    3. Smallest value indicates limiting reagent\n\n    **Method\
  \ 2: Product Method**\n    1. Calculate product formed from each reactant\n    2.\
  \ Reactant giving least product is limiting\n\n    ### Example 1: Simple Problem\n\
  \n    **Q: 10 g of H₂ reacts with 64 g of O₂. Find limiting reagent and mass of\
  \ H₂O formed.**\n\n    **2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O**\n\n    **Method 1: Mole Ratio**\n   \
  \ - Moles of H₂ = 10/2 = 5 mol\n    - Moles of O₂ = 64/32 = 2 mol\n    - H₂/coefficient:\
  \ 5/2 = 2.5\n    - O₂/coefficient: 2/1 = 2\n    - **O₂ is limiting reagent** (smaller\
  \ value)\n\n    **Product Calculation:**\n    - From equation: 1 mol O₂ → 2 mol\
  \ H₂O\n    - Moles of H₂O = 2 × 2 = 4 mol\n    - Mass of H₂O = 4 × 18 = 72 g\n\n\
  \    **Excess H₂ remaining:**\n    - H₂ consumed = 2 × 2 = 4 mol\n    - H₂ remaining\
  \ = 5 - 4 = 1 mol = 2 g\n\n    **Answer: O₂ is limiting, 72 g H₂O formed, 2 g H₂\
  \ excess**\n\n    ### Example 2: IIT JEE Level\n\n    **Q: 25 g of NH₃ and 50 g\
  \ of O₂ are mixed. Calculate:**\n    **(a) Limiting reagent**\n    **(b) Mass of\
  \ NO formed**\n    **(c) Mass of excess reagent left**\n\n    **4NH₃ + 5O₂ → 4NO\
  \ + 6H₂O**\n\n    Solution:\n\n    **(a) Finding limiting reagent:**\n    - Moles\
  \ of NH₃ = 25/17 = 1.47 mol\n    - Moles of O₂ = 50/32 = 1.56 mol\n    - NH₃/coefficient:\
  \ 1.47/4 = 0.3675\n    - O₂/coefficient: 1.56/5 = 0.312\n    - **NH₃ is limiting\
  \ reagent** (smaller value)\n\n    **(b) Mass of NO:**\n    - From equation: 4 mol\
  \ NH₃ → 4 mol NO\n    - Moles of NO = 1.47 mol\n    - Mass of NO = 1.47 × 30 = 44.1\
  \ g\n\n    **(c) Excess O₂:**\n    - O₂ required = (5/4) × 1.47 = 1.8375 mol\n \
  \   - Wait, this is more than available! Let me recalculate...\n\n    Actually,\
  \ let me recalculate:\n    - O₂ required for 1.47 mol NH₃ = (5/4) × 1.47 = 1.8375\
  \ mol\n    - O₂ available = 1.56 mol\n    - **O₂ is limiting reagent** (not enough\
  \ O₂)\n\n    Let me redo:\n    - From 1.56 mol O₂: NH₃ needed = (4/5) × 1.56 = 1.248\
  \ mol\n    - From 1.47 mol NH₃: O₂ needed = (5/4) × 1.47 = 1.8375 mol\n    - **O₂\
  \ is limiting** (not enough)\n\n    - NO formed from O₂: (4/5) × 1.56 = 1.248 mol\n\
  \    - Mass of NO = 1.248 × 30 = 37.44 g\n    - NH₃ consumed = 1.248 mol = 21.22\
  \ g\n    - NH₃ excess = 25 - 21.22 = 3.78 g\n\n    **Answer: (a) O₂ limiting, (b)\
  \ 37.44 g NO, (c) 3.78 g NH₃ excess**\n\n    ## Percentage Yield\n\n    **Actual\
  \ yield** = Amount of product actually obtained\n    **Theoretical yield** = Maximum\
  \ amount calculated from stoichiometry\n\n    **% Yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical\
  \ yield) × 100**\n\n    ### Example\n\n    **Q: 50 g of CaCO₃ on heating gives 20\
  \ g of CaO. Calculate % yield.**\n\n    **CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂**\n\n    Solution:\n\
  \    - Moles of CaCO₃ = 50/100 = 0.5 mol\n    - Theoretical moles of CaO = 0.5 mol\n\
  \    - Theoretical mass of CaO = 0.5 × 56 = 28 g\n    - Actual yield = 20 g\n  \
  \  - **% Yield = (20/28) × 100 = 71.43%**\n\n    ## Percentage Purity\n\n    **%\
  \ Purity = (Mass of pure substance / Total mass) × 100**\n\n    ### Example\n\n\
  \    **Q: An impure sample of CaCO₃ weighing 5 g reacts with excess HCl to produce\
  \ 1.12 L CO₂ at STP. Calculate % purity.**\n\n    **CaCO₃ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + H₂O +\
  \ CO₂**\n\n    Solution:\n    - Moles of CO₂ = 1.12/22.4 = 0.05 mol\n    - Moles\
  \ of pure CaCO₃ = 0.05 mol\n    - Mass of pure CaCO₃ = 0.05 × 100 = 5 g\n    - Wait,\
  \ this gives 100%!\n\n    Let me recalculate: If 1.12 L CO₂ is produced at STP:\n\
  \    - Moles of CO₂ = 1.12/22.4 = 0.05 mol\n    - Moles of CaCO₃ reacted = 0.05\
  \ mol\n    - Mass of pure CaCO₃ = 0.05 × 100 = 5 g\n\n    Hmm, this would be 100%\
  \ pure. The problem should have less CO₂. Let me correct:\n\n    Let's say it produces\
  \ 0.896 L CO₂:\n    - Moles of CO₂ = 0.896/22.4 = 0.04 mol\n    - Mass of pure CaCO₃\
  \ = 0.04 × 100 = 4 g\n    - **% Purity = (4/5) × 100 = 80%**\n\n    ## Advanced\
  \ IIT JEE Problem\n\n    **Q: 10.6 g of Na₂CO₃ is added to a solution containing\
  \ 12 g of CaCl₂. Calculate:**\n    **(a) Which is the limiting reagent?**\n    **(b)\
  \ Mass of CaCO₃ formed**\n    **(c) Number of moles of excess reagent left**\n\n\
  \    **Na₂CO₃ + CaCl₂ → CaCO₃ + 2NaCl**\n\n    Solution:\n\n    **(a) Limiting reagent:**\n\
  \    - Moles of Na₂CO₃ = 10.6/106 = 0.1 mol\n    - Moles of CaCl₂ = 12/111 = 0.108\
  \ mol\n    - Ratio is 1:1, so **Na₂CO₃ is limiting** (fewer moles)\n\n    **(b)\
  \ Mass of CaCO₃:**\n    - From equation: 1 mol Na₂CO₃ → 1 mol CaCO₃\n    - Moles\
  \ of CaCO₃ = 0.1 mol\n    - Mass = 0.1 × 100 = **10 g**\n\n    **(c) Excess CaCl₂:**\n\
  \    - CaCl₂ consumed = 0.1 mol\n    - CaCl₂ remaining = 0.108 - 0.1 = **0.008 mol**\n\
  \n    ## IIT JEE Key Points\n\n    1. **Always balance the equation first**\n  \
  \  2. **Limiting reagent** → smallest value of (moles/coefficient)\n    3. **Calculate\
  \ products from limiting reagent only**\n    4. **Percentage yield = (Actual/Theoretical)\
  \ × 100**\n    5. In limiting reagent problems:\n       - Find which runs out first\n\
  \       - Calculate product from that reagent\n       - Calculate excess of other\
  \ reagent\n    6. **Mass is conserved** → total mass of reactants = total mass of\
  \ products\n    7. For gases at STP: **1 mole = 22.4 L**\n\n    ## Common Mistakes\
  \ to Avoid\n\n    1. ❌ Using excess reagent to calculate products\n    2. ❌ Forgetting\
  \ to convert mass to moles\n    3. ❌ Not balancing equations before calculations\n\
  \    4. ❌ Confusing theoretical with actual yield\n    5. ❌ Not dividing by stoichiometric\
