  question: What is the percentage of nitrogen in ammonia (NH₃)? (Atomic masses -
    N=14, H=1)
  options:
  - 82.4%
  - 17.6%
  - 50.0%
  - 75.0%
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 82.4%
  explanation: 'To find percentage composition: **% element = (mass of element in
    1 mole / molar mass of compound) × 100**. For NH₃: (1) Molar mass = 14 + 3(1)
    = 17 g/mol. (2) Mass of N in 1 mole = 14 g. (3) **% N = (14/17) × 100 = 82.4%**.
    Similarly, % H = (3/17) × 100 = 17.6%. Note: Sum of all percentages = 82.4 +
    17.6 = 100% (always check!). This high nitrogen percentage makes ammonia valuable
    for nitrogen fertilizers. Percentage composition is useful for: verifying compound
    purity, determining empirical formulas from experimental data, comparing different
    compounds, calculating nutrient content in fertilizers.'

  question: 'A compound has the formula Fe₂O₃. What is the percentage of iron in this
    compound? (Atomic masses: Fe=56, O=16)'
  options:
  - 30.0%
  - 50.0%
  - 70.0%
  - 80.0%
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 70.0%
  explanation: 'Calculating percentage composition for Fe₂O₃ (iron(III) oxide, rust):
    **Step 1: Calculate molar mass** - Fe₂O₃ = 2(56) + 3(16) = 112 + 48 = 160 g/mol.
    **Step 2: Find mass of iron** - Mass of Fe = 2 × 56 = 112 g. **Step 3: Calculate
    percentage** - % Fe = (112/160) × 100 = **70.0%**. Similarly, % O = (48/160)
    × 100 = 30.0%. Verification: 70.0 + 30.0 = 100%. This means 1 kg of Fe₂O₃ contains
    700 g of pure iron, which is important in metallurgy for calculating iron yield
    from ores. Common iron ores: Haematite (Fe₂O₃, 70% Fe), Magnetite (Fe₃O₄, 72.4%
    Fe), Siderite (FeCO₃, 48.2% Fe). Higher percentage = more valuable ore.'
