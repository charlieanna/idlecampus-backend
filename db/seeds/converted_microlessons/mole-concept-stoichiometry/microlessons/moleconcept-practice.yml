  n = 11/44 = 0.25 mol. At STP, V = n × 22.4 = 0.25 × 22.4 = 5.6 L


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: How many molecules are present in 0.5 moles of water? (Avogadro's number
    = 6.022 × 10²³)
  options:
  - 3.011 × 10²³
  - 6.022 × 10²³
  - 1.204 × 10²⁴
  - 3.011 × 10²²
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 3.011 × 10²³
  explanation: 'Using the mole concept: **Number of molecules = moles × Avogadro''s
    number**. For 0.5 moles of H₂O: (1) Number of molecules = 0.5 × 6.022 × 10²³
    = **3.011 × 10²³ molecules**. Note: 1 mole of any substance contains exactly
    6.022 × 10²³ particles (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) - this is Avogadro''s number.
    The mole is a counting unit like "dozen" (12 items) but much larger! Examples:
    1 mole of H₂O = 6.022×10²³ molecules = 18 g. 1 mole of C atoms = 6.022×10²³ atoms
    = 12 g. 1 mole of electrons = 6.022×10²³ electrons. The mole concept bridges
    the atomic scale (individual atoms/molecules) with the macroscopic scale (grams,
    liters) that we can measure in the laboratory.'

  question: 'What is the mass of 2 moles of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)? (Atomic masses:
    Ca=40, C=12, O=16)'
  options:
  - 50 g
  - 100 g
  - 150 g
  - 200 g
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 200 g
  explanation: 'Calculating mass from moles: **Mass = moles × molar mass**. For CaCO₃:
    (1) **Molar mass** = 40 + 12 + 3(16) = 40 + 12 + 48 = 100 g/mol. (2) **Mass**
    = 2 moles × 100 g/mol = **200 g**. The molar mass is the mass of one mole of
    a substance and equals the sum of atomic masses of all atoms in the formula. Key
    relationships in mole concept: **moles = mass/molar mass**, **moles = volume/22.4
    (at STP)**, **moles = number of particles/Avogadro''s number**. These three equations
    connect mass, volume, and number of particles through the central concept of the
    mole. Example: 200 g CaCO₃ = 2 moles = 2 × 6.022×10²³ = 1.204×10²⁴ formula units.'
