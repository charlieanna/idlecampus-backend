  \ Mole Concept\n\n    ## Introduction\n\n    The **mole concept** is the foundation\
  \ of quantitative chemistry. It connects the microscopic world of atoms and molecules\
  \ to the macroscopic world of grams and liters.\n\n    ## Atomic Mass Unit (amu\
  \ or u)\n\n    **Definition:** 1/12th of the mass of one carbon-12 atom\n\n    -\
  \ 1 amu = 1.66054 × 10⁻²⁴ g\n    - Also called unified mass (u)\n\n    ## Average\
  \ Atomic Mass\n\n    For elements with isotopes, atomic mass is the weighted average:\n\
  \n    **Average atomic mass = Σ (isotope mass × abundance)**\n\n    ### Example:\
  \ Chlorine\n    - Cl-35: mass = 35 u, abundance = 75%\n    - Cl-37: mass = 37 u,\
  \ abundance = 25%\n    - Average atomic mass = (35 × 0.75) + (37 × 0.25) = 35.5\
  \ u\n\n    ## Molecular Mass\n\n    **Molecular mass** = Sum of atomic masses of\
  \ all atoms in a molecule\n\n    ### Examples:\n    - H₂O: (2 × 1) + (1 × 16) =\
  \ 18 u\n    - H₂SO₄: (2 × 1) + (1 × 32) + (4 × 16) = 98 u\n    - C₆H₁₂O₆: (6 × 12)\
  \ + (12 × 1) + (6 × 16) = 180 u\n\n    ## Formula Mass\n\n    For ionic compounds\
  \ (which don't form molecules), we use **formula mass**:\n\n    - NaCl: 23 + 35.5\
  \ = 58.5 u\n    - CaCO₃: 40 + 12 + (3 × 16) = 100 u\n\n    ## The Mole Concept\n\
  \n    ### Definition of Mole\n\n    **One mole** is the amount of substance that\
  \ contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in exactly 12 g of carbon-12.\n\
  \n    **1 mole = 6.022 × 10²³ entities** (Avogadro's Number, Nₐ)\n\n    ### Avogadro's\
  \ Number\n\n    Nₐ = 6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹\n\n    This is one of the most important\
  \ constants in chemistry.\n\n    ## Molar Mass\n\n    **Molar mass (M)** = Mass\
  \ of 1 mole of substance (in grams)\n\n    - Numerically equal to atomic/molecular\
  \ mass\n    - Units: g/mol or g mol⁻¹\n\n    ### Examples:\n    - H₂O: Molar mass\
  \ = 18 g/mol\n    - NaCl: Molar mass = 58.5 g/mol\n    - H₂SO₄: Molar mass = 98\
  \ g/mol\n\n    ## Important Relationships\n\n    ### Number of Moles\n\n    **n\
  \ = w/M**\n\n    Where:\n    - n = number of moles\n    - w = mass in grams\n  \
  \  - M = molar mass in g/mol\n\n    ### Number of Particles\n\n    **N = n × Nₐ\
  \ = (w/M) × Nₐ**\n\n    Where:\n    - N = number of particles (atoms/molecules)\n\
  \    - Nₐ = Avogadro's number\n\n    ### Mass from Moles\n\n    **w = n × M**\n\n\
  \    ## Molar Volume of Gases\n\n    At STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure):\n\
  \    - Temperature: 273 K (0°C)\n    - Pressure: 1 atm (101.325 kPa)\n\n    **1\
  \ mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L at STP**\n\n    This is called **molar volume**\
  \ (Vₘ)\n\n    For gases: **n = V/22.4** (at STP)\n\n    ## Solved Problems\n\n \
  \   ### Problem 1: Calculate moles from mass\n\n    **Q: How many moles are present\
  \ in 49 g of H₂SO₄?**\n\n    Solution:\n    - Molar mass of H₂SO₄ = 98 g/mol\n \
  \   - n = w/M = 49/98 = 0.5 mol\n\n    **Answer: 0.5 mol**\n\n    ### Problem 2:\
  \ Calculate number of molecules\n\n    **Q: How many molecules are present in 9\
  \ g of water?**\n\n    Solution:\n    - Molar mass of H₂O = 18 g/mol\n    - n =\
  \ 9/18 = 0.5 mol\n    - N = n × Nₐ = 0.5 × 6.022 × 10²³\n    - N = 3.011 × 10²³\

  \n    Solution:\n    - Number of H₂O molecules = 3.011 × 10²³\n    - Each H₂O has\
  \ 2 H atoms\n    - Total H atoms = 2 × 3.011 × 10²³ = 6.022 × 10²³\n\n    **Answer:\
  \ 6.022 × 10²³ atoms**\n\n    ### Problem 4: Gas volume at STP\n\n    **Q: What\
  \ volume will 8 g of O₂ occupy at STP?**\n\n    Solution:\n    - Molar mass of O₂\
  \ = 32 g/mol\n    - n = 8/32 = 0.25 mol\n    - V = n × 22.4 = 0.25 × 22.4 = 5.6\
  \ L\n\n    **Answer: 5.6 L**\n\n    ### Problem 5: IIT JEE Level\n\n    **Q: Calculate\

  \ mass of NH₄⁺ = 14 + 4(1) = 18 g/mol\n    - n = 1.8/18 = 0.1 mol\n    - Electrons\
  \ in NH₄⁺: N has 7, 4H have 4, minus 1 for charge = 10 electrons\n    - Total electrons\
  \ = 0.1 × 10 × 6.022 × 10²³\n    - = 6.022 × 10²³ electrons\n\n    **Answer: 6.022\
  \ × 10²³ electrons**\n\n    ## Key Formulas Summary\n\n    | Quantity | Formula\
  \ | Units |\n    |----------|---------|-------|\n    | Number of moles | n = w/M\
  \ | mol |\n    | Number of particles | N = n × Nₐ | - |\n    | Mass | w = n × M\

  \ w/n | g/mol |\n\n    ## IIT JEE Tips\n\n    1. **Always check units** - convert\
  \ to standard units (g, mol, L)\n    2. For **ions**, adjust electron count based\
  \ on charge\n    3. For **molecules**, multiply by number of atoms per molecule\n\
  \    4. **At STP**: 1 mole = 22.4 L (for any gas)\n    5. Remember: **Avogadro's\
  \ number applies to all entities** (atoms, molecules, ions, electrons)\n    6. **Molar\
  \ mass in grams** = molecular mass in amu (numerically)\n\n    ## Practice Tips\n\
  \n    - Master unit conversions early\n    - Practice identifying the type of entity\
  \ (atom/molecule/ion)\n    - Draw a concept map: mass ↔ moles ↔ particles ↔ volume\n\
  \    - For complex problems, always start with finding moles first\n\n## Key Points\n\
