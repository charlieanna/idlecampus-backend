  C: 40/12 = 3.33, H: 6.67/1 = 6.67, O: 53.33/16 = 3.33. Ratio = 3.33:6.67:3.33 =
  1:2:1. Empirical formula = CH₂O

  question: A compound contains 40% carbon, 6.67% hydrogen, and 53.33% oxygen by mass.
    What is its empirical formula?

  question: A hydrocarbon contains 85.7% carbon and 14.3% hydrogen by mass. What is
    its empirical formula?
  options:
  - CH
  - CH₂
  - CH₃
  - CH₄
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: CH₂
  explanation: 'To find the empirical formula from percentage composition: (1) Convert
    percentages to moles by dividing by atomic masses: **C: 85.7/12 = 7.14 mol, H:
    14.3/1 = 14.3 mol**. (2) Find the simplest mole ratio by dividing by the smallest
    value: C: 7.14/7.14 = 1, H: 14.3/7.14 = 2. (3) The empirical formula = **CH₂**.
    This is the empirical formula for many hydrocarbons including ethene (C₂H₄), propene
    (C₃H₆), butene (C₄H₈), etc. Note: The empirical formula shows the simplest whole
    number ratio of atoms, while the molecular formula shows the actual number of
    atoms in a molecule. If the molar mass is given, we can find molecular formula
    = n × empirical formula, where n = (molar mass)/(empirical formula mass).'

  question: 'A compound contains 52.2% carbon, 13.0% hydrogen, and 34.8% oxygen by
    mass. What is its empirical formula? (Atomic masses: C=12, H=1, O=16)'
  options:
  - C₂H₆O
  - C₃H₈O
  - CH₃O
  - C₄H₁₀O
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: C₂H₆O
  explanation: 'Finding empirical formula from percentage composition: **Step 1: Convert
    percentages to moles** - C: 52.2/12 = 4.35 mol, H: 13.0/1 = 13.0 mol, O: 34.8/16
    = 2.175 mol. **Step 2: Divide by smallest value** - C: 4.35/2.175 = 2, H: 13.0/2.175
    = 6, O: 2.175/2.175 = 1. **Step 3: Write empirical formula** - C₂H₆O (ethanol).
    This represents the simplest ratio of atoms. The actual molecular formula could
    be C₂H₆O (ethanol), C₄H₁₂O₂ (diethyl ether), etc. To determine molecular formula,
    we need the molar mass: molecular formula = n × empirical formula, where n = (given
    molar mass)/(empirical formula mass). For C₂H₆O: empirical mass = 2(12) + 6(1)
    + 16 = 46 g/mol.'
