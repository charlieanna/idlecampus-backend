  Empirical mass = 12 + 2 + 16 = 30. n = 180/30 = 6. Molecular formula = 6 × CH₂O
  = C₆H₁₂O₆ (glucose)


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: The empirical formula of a compound is CH₂O and its molar mass is 180
    g/mol. What is its molecular formula?

  question: A compound has empirical formula CH and a molar mass of 78 g/mol. What
    is its molecular formula?
  options:
  - CH
  - C₂H₂
  - C₆H₆
  - C₈H₈
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: C₆H₆
  explanation: 'To find molecular formula from empirical formula: **Molecular formula
    = n × Empirical formula**, where **n = (Molar mass) / (Empirical formula mass)**.
    For this compound: (1) Empirical formula = CH, empirical mass = 12 + 1 = 13 g/mol.
    (2) n = 78/13 = 6. (3) Molecular formula = 6 × CH = **C₆H₆** (benzene). Benzene
    is an aromatic hydrocarbon with a ring structure. Note: Different compounds can
    have the same empirical formula but different molecular formulas. Examples with
    empirical formula CH: C₂H₂ (ethyne/acetylene, molar mass 26), C₄H₄ (vinylacetylene,
    molar mass 52), C₆H₆ (benzene, molar mass 78), C₈H₈ (styrene, molar mass 104).
    The molecular formula always contains the empirical formula as a whole number
    multiple.'

  question: 'The empirical formula of a hydrocarbon is CH₃ and its vapor density is
    15. What is its molecular formula? (Molar mass = 2 × Vapor density)'
  options:
  - CH₃
  - C₂H₆
  - C₃H₉
  - C₄H₁₂
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: C₂H₆
  explanation: 'Finding molecular formula using vapor density: **Step 1: Calculate
    molar mass** - Molar mass = 2 × Vapor density = 2 × 15 = 30 g/mol. **Step 2:
    Find empirical formula mass** - CH₃ = 12 + 3(1) = 15 g/mol. **Step 3: Calculate
    n** - n = (Molar mass)/(Empirical mass) = 30/15 = 2. **Step 4: Molecular formula**
    - 2 × CH₃ = **C₂H₆** (ethane). Note: Vapor density = (Molar mass)/2, or Molar
    mass = 2 × Vapor density (only for ideal gases). This relationship comes from
    the definition: vapor density = (density of gas)/(density of H₂), and since density
    ∝ molar mass, vapor density = (M_gas)/(M_H₂) = M/2. Ethane (C₂H₆) is a component
    of natural gas and used as fuel.'
