  Moles of H₂ = 4/2 = 2 mol. From equation: 2 mol H₂ → 2 mol H₂O. Mass of H₂O = 2
  × 18 = 36 g


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'In the reaction 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O, how many grams of water are formed
    from 4 g of hydrogen? (Atomic masses: H=1, O=16)'

  question: 'For the reaction N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃, how many moles of NH₃ are produced
    from 3 moles of H₂? (Assume sufficient N₂ is present)'
  options:
  - 1 mole
  - 2 moles
  - 3 moles
  - 6 moles
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 2 moles
  explanation: 'Solving stoichiometry problems using mole ratios: From the balanced
    equation **N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃**, the mole ratio is: 1 mole N₂ : 3 moles H₂ : 2
    moles NH₃. (1) Given 3 moles of H₂, (2) Using ratio: 3 moles H₂ × (2 moles NH₃/3
    moles H₂) = **2 moles NH₃**. The key to stoichiometry is using coefficients from
    the balanced equation as mole ratios. Steps for any stoichiometry problem: (1)
    Write balanced equation, (2) Convert given quantity to moles, (3) Use mole ratio
    from balanced equation, (4) Convert moles to desired units. Example: If we have
    6 moles H₂, we get 6 × (2/3) = 4 moles NH₃. The Haber process (N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃)
    is crucial for producing ammonia for fertilizers, feeding billions of people worldwide.'

  question: 'In the combustion reaction C₃H₈ + 5O₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O, how many moles
    of CO₂ are produced from burning 2 moles of propane (C₃H₈)?'
  options:
  - 2 moles
  - 3 moles
  - 6 moles
  - 8 moles
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 6 moles
  explanation: 'Stoichiometry with combustion reactions: From the balanced equation
    **C₃H₈ + 5O₂ → 3CO₂ + 4H₂O**, the mole ratio is: 1 mole C₃H₈ : 5 moles O₂ :
    3 moles CO₂ : 4 moles H₂O. (1) Given: 2 moles of C₃H₈, (2) Using ratio: 2 moles
    C₃H₈ × (3 moles CO₂/1 mole C₃H₈) = **6 moles CO₂**. Similarly, 2 moles C₃H₈
    produces: 2 × 5 = 10 moles O₂ consumed, 2 × 4 = 8 moles H₂O produced. Combustion
    of propane: Common fuel for cooking, heating, and vehicles (LPG = liquefied petroleum
    gas). Complete combustion produces CO₂ and H₂O. Incomplete combustion (insufficient
    O₂) produces toxic CO (carbon monoxide) and soot (C). Always ensure proper ventilation!'
