  CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂. Moles CaCO₃ = 100/100 = 1 mol. Theoretical CaO = 1 × 56 = 56
  g. % Yield = (50/56) × 100 = 89.3%


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'In a reaction, the theoretical yield is 80 g but the actual yield is
    60 g. What is the percentage yield?'
  options:
  - 60%
  - 75%
  - 80%
  - 133%
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 75%
  explanation: 'Calculating percentage yield: **% Yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical
    yield) × 100**. Given: Actual yield = 60 g, Theoretical yield = 80 g. (1) % Yield
    = (60/80) × 100 = **75%**. Theoretical yield is the maximum amount of product
    that can be formed from given reactants (calculated using stoichiometry). Actual
    yield is what we actually obtain in the lab (always less than theoretical). Reasons
    for yield < 100%: (1) Incomplete reactions (equilibrium), (2) Side reactions producing
    other products, (3) Loss during transfer/purification, (4) Reversible reactions.
    Note: % yield can NEVER exceed 100% (violates law of conservation of mass). If
    you calculate >100%, check for: impure product, experimental errors, or calculation
    mistakes. Industrial processes aim for high yields to maximize profit and minimize
    waste.'

  question: 'A reaction has a theoretical yield of 25 g. If the percentage yield
    is 80%, what is the actual yield?'
  options:
  - 20 g
  - 25 g
  - 30 g
  - 31.25 g
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 20 g
  explanation: 'Finding actual yield from percentage yield: Rearranging the formula
    **% Yield = (Actual yield / Theoretical yield) × 100**, we get: **Actual yield
    = (% Yield × Theoretical yield) / 100**. Given: Theoretical yield = 25 g, % Yield
    = 80%. (1) Actual yield = (80 × 25) / 100 = 2000 / 100 = **20 g**. This means
    out of maximum possible 25 g, we obtained 20 g (80% efficiency). Example: In
    pharmaceutical industry, if a drug synthesis has theoretical yield of 100 kg but
    actual yield is 85 kg, then % yield = 85%. Companies optimize reaction conditions
    (temperature, pressure, catalysts, time) to maximize yield. Economic impact: Higher
    yields reduce costs, waste, and environmental impact. Even 1% improvement in a
    large-scale industrial process can save millions of dollars annually!'
