  question: 'The bleaching action of SO₂ is:'
  options:
  - Permanent due to oxidation
  - Temporary due to reduction
  - Permanent due to reduction
  - Temporary due to oxidation
  correct_answer: Temporary due to reduction
  explanation: "The bleaching action of SO₂ is temporary and occurs by reduction. SO₂ reacts with water to form sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃), which reduces colored compounds to colorless compounds. However, these colorless compounds can be re-oxidized by atmospheric oxygen over time, causing the color to return. This is in contrast to chlorine, which bleaches permanently by oxidation - it oxidizes colored substances to colorless compounds that cannot easily revert back. The equation for SO₂ bleaching: SO₂ + H₂O → H₂SO₃ (reduces colored matter to colorless)."

  question: What is the shape of SO₂ molecule?
  options:
  - Linear
  - Bent/V-shaped
  - Trigonal planar
  - Tetrahedral
  correct_answer: Bent/V-shaped
  explanation: "Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) has a bent or V-shaped molecular geometry with a bond angle of approximately 119°. The sulfur atom undergoes sp² hybridization and has one lone pair of electrons. The molecule has a resonance structure with S=O double bonds. The presence of the lone pair causes repulsion, resulting in the bent shape rather than a linear geometry. This bent structure makes SO₂ a polar molecule, contributing to its solubility in water and its ability to act as both a reducing agent and an acidic oxide."

  question: Which property makes concentrated H₂SO₄ a good dehydrating agent?
  options:
  - It has high acidity
  - It has strong affinity for water
  - It is a strong oxidizing agent
  - It has high molecular mass
  correct_answer: It has strong affinity for water
  explanation: "Concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is an excellent dehydrating agent because it has a very strong affinity for water. It is highly hygroscopic and absorbs water readily, releasing large amounts of heat in the process. This property allows it to remove water from substances, even from organic compounds by abstracting hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the ratio 2:1. For example, it dehydrates sucrose (C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁) to carbon, leaving a black char: C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ → 12C + 11H₂O. While concentrated H₂SO₄ is also acidic and oxidizing, its dehydrating action is primarily due to its strong water affinity."
