  3Cu + 8HNO₃(dilute) → 3Cu(NO₃)₂ + 2NO + 4H₂O. Dilute HNO₃ gives NO. Concentrated
  HNO₃ gives NO₂.


  ## Key Points

  question: Nitric acid acts as an oxidizing agent. When it reacts with copper, which
    product is formed with dilute HNO₃?
  options:
  - NO (nitric oxide)
  - NO₂ (nitrogen dioxide)
  - N₂O (nitrous oxide)
  - N₂ (nitrogen gas)
  correct_answer: NO (nitric oxide)
  explanation: "When dilute nitric acid reacts with copper, nitric oxide (NO) is produced as the reduction product. The equation is: 3Cu + 8HNO₃(dilute) → 3Cu(NO₃)₂ + 2NO + 4H₂O. NO is a colorless gas that turns brown in air due to oxidation to NO₂. In contrast, concentrated HNO₃ produces NO₂ (brown fumes) when reacting with copper: Cu + 4HNO₃(conc) → Cu(NO₃)₂ + 2NO₂ + 2H₂O. The different products reflect the different oxidizing strengths of dilute versus concentrated nitric acid."

  question: What is aqua regia and what is its composition?
  options:
  - Mixture of HCl and HNO₃ in 3:1 ratio
  - Mixture of H₂SO₄ and HNO₃ in 1:1 ratio
  - Mixture of HCl and H₂SO₄ in 2:1 ratio
  - Pure concentrated HNO₃
  correct_answer: Mixture of HCl and HNO₃ in 3:1 ratio
  explanation: "Aqua regia (meaning 'royal water') is a mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) and concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃) in a 3:1 volume ratio. It is called 'royal water' because it can dissolve noble metals like gold and platinum, which are not dissolved by either acid alone. The mixture is more powerful than either acid individually because HCl provides chloride ions that form soluble chloro-complexes with the metals, while HNO₃ acts as the oxidizing agent. The reaction produces nascent chlorine and nitrosyl chloride (NOCl), which are highly reactive."

  question: Why does pure nitric acid turn yellow on standing?
  options:
  - It reacts with atmospheric oxygen
  - It decomposes to form NO₂
  - It absorbs moisture from air
  - It reacts with carbon dioxide
  correct_answer: It decomposes to form NO₂
  explanation: "Pure nitric acid is colorless when freshly prepared, but turns yellow on standing due to its partial decomposition to nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), which is a brown gas. The decomposition reaction is: 4HNO₃ → 4NO₂ + 2H₂O + O₂. This decomposition is accelerated by light and heat, which is why nitric acid is stored in dark brown bottles. The dissolved NO₂ gives the acid a yellow to brown color. This is also why old or impure nitric acid samples often have a yellowish tint."
