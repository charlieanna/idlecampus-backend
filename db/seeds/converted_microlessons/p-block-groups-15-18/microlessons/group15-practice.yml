  question: 'The electronic configuration of Group 15 elements is:'
  options:
  - ns² np³
  - ns² np⁵
  - ns² np⁴
  - ns² np⁶
  correct_answer: ns² np³
  explanation: "Group 15 elements (nitrogen family: N, P, As, Sb, Bi) have 5 valence electrons with the general electronic configuration ns² np³. This gives them half-filled p-orbitals (one electron in each of the three p orbitals), which provides extra stability. ns² np⁵ is for Group 17 (halogens), ns² np⁴ is for Group 16 (chalcogens), and ns² np⁶ is for Group 18 (noble gases)."

  question: What is the maximum covalency that nitrogen can exhibit?
  options:
  - 3
  - 4
  - 5
  - 6
  correct_answer: 4
  explanation: "Nitrogen can exhibit a maximum covalency of 4, as seen in the ammonium ion (NH₄⁺), where nitrogen forms four bonds using one dative (coordinate) bond. Nitrogen cannot expand its octet beyond 4 bonds because it lacks d-orbitals in its valence shell (only 2s and 2p orbitals available). In contrast, other Group 15 elements like phosphorus can show maximum covalency of 5 or 6 (e.g., PCl₅, PF₅) because they have vacant d-orbitals available for bonding. This is one of nitrogen's anomalous properties."

  question: Which trend is observed for the stability of +5 and +3 oxidation states in Group 15 elements?
  options:
  - Both +5 and +3 increase down the group
  - +5 decreases, +3 increases down the group
  - +5 increases, +3 decreases down the group
  - Both remain constant down the group
  correct_answer: +5 decreases, +3 increases down the group
  explanation: "In Group 15 elements, the stability of the +5 oxidation state decreases down the group (from N to Bi), while the stability of the +3 oxidation state increases down the group. This is due to the inert pair effect, where the ns² pair of electrons becomes increasingly reluctant to participate in bonding as we move down the group due to poor shielding by d and f electrons. Thus, nitrogen prefers +5 state (HNO₃), while bismuth prefers +3 state (BiCl₃). Phosphorus shows both states fairly well (H₃PO₄ for +5, H₃PO₃ for +3)."
