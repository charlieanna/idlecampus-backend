  question: Which Group 16 element exists as diatomic molecules at room temperature?
  options:
  - Oxygen
  - Sulfur
  - Selenium
  - Tellurium
  correct_answer: Oxygen
  explanation: "Oxygen exists as diatomic O₂ molecules at room temperature due to strong pπ-pπ double bonding (O=O). This is an anomalous property of oxygen due to its small size and absence of d-orbitals. Sulfur exists as S₈ (octatomic) ring molecules, while selenium and tellurium exist as polymeric chain structures. The ability of oxygen to form strong multiple bonds (pπ-pπ) is not shared by heavier Group 16 elements, which prefer single bonds and polymeric structures."

  question: What is the oxidation state of sulfur in H₂SO₄?
  options:
  - +4
  - +6
  - +2
  - -2
  correct_answer: +6
  explanation: "In sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), sulfur has an oxidation state of +6, which is the highest oxidation state shown by Group 16 elements. This can be calculated as: 2(+1) from H + x from S + 4(-2) from O = 0, giving x = +6. Sulfur can show oxidation states of -2, +2, +4, and +6. The +6 state is shown in sulfuric acid and sulfur trioxide (SO₃), while +4 is shown in sulfurous acid (H₂SO₃) and sulfur dioxide (SO₂). The stability of +6 oxidation state decreases down the group due to inert pair effect."

  question: Why does H₂O have a much higher boiling point than H₂S?
  options:
  - H₂O has stronger covalent bonds
  - H₂O exhibits extensive hydrogen bonding
  - H₂O has higher molecular mass
  - H₂O is more acidic than H₂S
  correct_answer: H₂O exhibits extensive hydrogen bonding
  explanation: "H₂O has a much higher boiling point (100°C) compared to H₂S (-60°C) because water molecules form extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Oxygen is highly electronegative and small in size, creating strong O-H bonds with significant polarity. This allows strong hydrogen bonding between water molecules, requiring more energy to break during boiling. H₂S cannot form effective hydrogen bonds because sulfur is less electronegative and larger, making the S-H bond less polar. This is an example of oxygen's anomalous behavior in Group 16."
