  F is most reactive, HI is strongest acid. But F₂ has lower bond energy than Cl₂
  (repulsion). Only Cl, Br, I show positive states; F only shows -1.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which statements about halogens are correct?
  options:
  - Fluorine is most reactive halogen
  - HI is strongest halogen acid
  - F₂ has highest bond dissociation energy
  - All halogens can show positive oxidation states
  correct_answer: HI is strongest halogen acid
  explanation: "Both statements 1 and 2 are correct. Fluorine is indeed the most reactive halogen due to its high electronegativity. HI is the strongest halogen acid because the H-I bond is weakest (largest atomic size, longest bond). However, statement 3 is false - F₂ actually has lower bond dissociation energy than Cl₂ due to lone pair-lone pair repulsion in the small F atom. Statement 4 is false because fluorine, being most electronegative, shows only -1 oxidation state; only Cl, Br, and I can show positive oxidation states."

  question: Why does F₂ have lower bond dissociation energy than Cl₂?
  options:
  - Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine
  - F₂ molecule has strong inter-electronic repulsion between lone pairs
  - Fluorine has larger atomic size
  - F₂ has weaker covalent bonds
  correct_answer: F₂ molecule has strong inter-electronic repulsion between lone pairs
  explanation: "F₂ has lower bond dissociation energy than Cl₂ despite fluorine being more electronegative. This is due to the very small size of fluorine atoms, which causes the lone pairs on adjacent fluorine atoms in F₂ to be extremely close together, resulting in strong lone pair-lone pair repulsion. This repulsion weakens the F-F bond, making it easier to break than the Cl-Cl bond. The bond dissociation energy order is Cl₂ > Br₂ > F₂ > I₂, showing that F₂ is anomalous in this trend."

  question: Which halogen can show the highest oxidation state?
  options:
  - Fluorine (+7)
  - Chlorine (+7)
  - Bromine (+5)
  - Iodine (+5)
  correct_answer: Chlorine (+7)
  explanation: "Chlorine can show the highest oxidation state of +7 in compounds like perchloric acid (HClO₄) and perchlorates (ClO₄⁻). Bromine and iodine can also show +7 state, but chlorine compounds in +7 state are most stable. Fluorine, being the most electronegative element, shows only -1 oxidation state and cannot exhibit positive oxidation states. Other halogens (Cl, Br, I) can show positive oxidation states of +1, +3, +5, and +7 because they have vacant d-orbitals available for bonding."
