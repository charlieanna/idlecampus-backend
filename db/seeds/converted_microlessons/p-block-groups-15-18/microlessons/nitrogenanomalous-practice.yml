  Nitrogen exists as N₂ with strong triple bond, has maximum covalency 4 (no d-orbitals),
  unlike heavier elements which can expand octet.

  question: Which are anomalous properties of nitrogen?
  options:
  - Exists as diatomic N₂ with strong triple bond
  - Maximum covalency of 4 due to lack of d-orbitals
  - Forms stable multiple bonds (pπ-pπ)
  - All of the above
  correct_answer: All of the above
  explanation: "All the listed properties are anomalous characteristics of nitrogen compared to other Group 15 elements. Nitrogen exists as diatomic N₂ molecules with a very strong triple bond (944 kJ/mol), while other Group 15 elements exist as solids (P₄, As, etc.). Nitrogen has a maximum covalency of 4 because it lacks d-orbitals and cannot expand its octet (contrast with P in PCl₅). Nitrogen forms stable multiple bonds using pπ-pπ bonding (N=N, N≡N), while heavier elements prefer single bonds. These anomalies arise from nitrogen's small size, high electronegativity, and absence of d-orbitals."

  question: Why is the N-N single bond weaker than the P-P single bond?
  options:
  - Nitrogen has lower electronegativity
  - Small size of nitrogen causes high lone pair-lone pair repulsion
  - Nitrogen forms ionic bonds more easily
  - Nitrogen has larger atomic radius
  correct_answer: Small size of nitrogen causes high lone pair-lone pair repulsion
  explanation: "The N-N single bond is weaker than the P-P single bond because nitrogen's very small atomic size brings the lone pairs on adjacent nitrogen atoms very close together, causing strong lone pair-lone pair repulsion. This repulsion weakens the N-N single bond significantly. However, nitrogen compensates by forming exceptionally strong multiple bonds (N=N, N≡N) through effective pπ-pπ overlap. The N≡N triple bond is one of the strongest known bonds (944 kJ/mol), making N₂ very stable and unreactive. This is why nitrogen exists as N₂ rather than forming polymeric structures like phosphorus."

  question: Why can phosphorus form PCl₅ but nitrogen cannot form NCl₅?
  options:
  - Nitrogen is less electronegative than phosphorus
  - Nitrogen lacks d-orbitals and cannot expand its octet
  - Nitrogen has larger atomic size
  - Nitrogen forms stronger bonds with chlorine
  correct_answer: Nitrogen lacks d-orbitals and cannot expand its octet
  explanation: "Phosphorus can form PCl₅ because it has vacant 3d orbitals available that allow it to expand its octet and achieve a maximum covalency of 5 or 6 using sp³d or sp³d² hybridization. Nitrogen, being in the second period, only has 2s and 2p orbitals available (no d-orbitals), so it cannot expand beyond an octet and has a maximum covalency of 4. Nitrogen can achieve 4 bonds in compounds like NH₄⁺ by forming a dative bond, but it cannot form five or more bonds like phosphorus does in PCl₅ or PF₅."
