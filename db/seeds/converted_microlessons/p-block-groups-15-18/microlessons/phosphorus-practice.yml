  White phosphorus (P₄) is highly reactive, spontaneously ignites in air, must be
  stored under water. Red and black are less reactive.

  question: Which allotrope of phosphorus is most reactive?
  options:
  - White phosphorus
  - Red phosphorus
  - Black phosphorus
  - All equally reactive
  correct_answer: White phosphorus
  explanation: "White phosphorus (P₄) is the most reactive allotrope of phosphorus. It has a tetrahedral P₄ molecular structure with high angle strain (60° instead of ideal 109.5°), making it highly reactive. It spontaneously ignites in air at about 35°C and must be stored under water. Red phosphorus is less reactive and more stable (polymeric structure), while black phosphorus is the least reactive allotrope with a layered structure similar to graphite."

  question: Why must white phosphorus be stored under water?
  options:
  - It reacts violently with water
  - It spontaneously ignites in air
  - It dissolves in air
  - It is hygroscopic
  correct_answer: It spontaneously ignites in air
  explanation: "White phosphorus must be stored under water because it spontaneously ignites in air at approximately 35°C (autoignition temperature). The high reactivity is due to the angular strain in the tetrahedral P₄ molecule, where the P-P-P bond angles are only 60° instead of the ideal tetrahedral angle of 109.5°. Water prevents contact with oxygen in the air, thus preventing combustion. White phosphorus does not react with water at room temperature, making water an ideal storage medium for this highly reactive allotrope."

  question: What is the bond angle in phosphine (PH₃)?
  options:
  - 107°
  - 93.5°
  - 109.5°
  - 120°
  correct_answer: 93.5°
  explanation: "Phosphine (PH₃) has a bond angle of approximately 93.5°, which is significantly less than the bond angle in ammonia (107°). This is because phosphorus uses almost pure p-orbitals for bonding (with very little s-character), while nitrogen in ammonia uses sp³ hybrid orbitals. The lower s-character in P-H bonds means less directional character and smaller bond angles. Additionally, the larger size of phosphorus means the bonding pairs are farther apart, reducing bond pair-bond pair repulsion. This is why PH₃ is pyramidal but with a smaller bond angle than NH₃."
