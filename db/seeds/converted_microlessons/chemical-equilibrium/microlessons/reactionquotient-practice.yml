  When Q < K, the reaction proceeds forward to increase the concentration of products
  and reach equilibrium.


  ## Key Points

  question: 'If Q < K, the reaction will proceed:'
  options:
  - Forward to form more products
  - Backward to form more reactants
  - No net change (already at equilibrium)
  - Cannot determine without temperature data
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Forward to form more products
  explanation: 'When Q < K (reaction quotient less than equilibrium constant), it
    means the ratio of products to reactants is currently less than it will be at
    equilibrium. The system has too few products and too many reactants compared to
    equilibrium. Therefore, the reaction proceeds in the forward direction (→) to
    form more products and consume reactants until Q = K (equilibrium is reached).
    Conversely: if Q > K, reaction goes backward; if Q = K, system is already at equilibrium
    with no net change. The reaction quotient Q is calculated the same way as K but
    using current concentrations, not equilibrium concentrations: Q = [products]/[reactants].'

  question: For the reaction 2SO₂(g) + O₂(g) ⇌ 2SO₃(g) with Kc = 100, if current concentrations are [SO₂] = 0.2 M, [O₂] = 0.1 M, and [SO₃] = 2 M, what is Q and which direction will the reaction proceed?
  options:
  - Q = 100, no net change
  - Q = 1000, shifts left (backward)
  - Q = 10, shifts right (forward)
  - Q = 0.01, shifts right (forward)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Q = 1000, shifts left (backward)
  explanation: 'Q = 1000, and the reaction will shift left (backward toward reactants). Calculate Q using current concentrations: Q = [SO₃]²/([SO₂]²[O₂]) = (2)²/((0.2)²(0.1)) = 4/(0.04 × 0.1) = 4/0.004 = 1000. Compare Q with K: Q = 1000 > K = 100. Since Q > K, the reaction has too many products and too few reactants compared to equilibrium. The system must shift backward (left, ←) to consume SO₃ and produce more SO₂ and O₂ until Q decreases to equal K = 100. Decision rule: Q > K → shift left (make more reactants), Q < K → shift right (make more products), Q = K → at equilibrium (no net change). Calculating Q helps predict reaction direction before reaching equilibrium.'

  question: What is the relationship between Q and K when a system is at equilibrium?
  options:
  - Q < K
  - Q > K
  - Q = K
  - Q = 1/K
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Q = K
  explanation: 'At equilibrium, Q = K. The reaction quotient Q equals the equilibrium constant K only when the system is at equilibrium. At this point, the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, and concentrations remain constant (though reactions continue at the molecular level - dynamic equilibrium). Before equilibrium: Q ≠ K, and the system shifts to make Q approach K. If Q < K, reaction goes forward until Q increases to equal K. If Q > K, reaction goes backward until Q decreases to equal K. Once Q = K, no further net change occurs. Example: for H₂ + I₂ ⇌ 2HI with K = 50, if initially Q = 10 (< K), HI forms until Q = 50 = K. Q is a snapshot of the current state, while K is the target destination. Q can have any value initially, but at equilibrium, Q must equal K. Temperature changes K, which means Q ≠ K temporarily until the system re-equilibrates.'
