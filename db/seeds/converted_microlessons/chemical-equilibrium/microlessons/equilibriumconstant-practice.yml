  question: For H₂ + I₂ ⇌ 2HI at equilibrium with [H₂]=0.2 M, [I₂]=0.2 M, [HI]=1.6 M, what is Kc?
  options:
  - '4'
  - '16'
  - '32'
  - '64'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '64'
  explanation: 'Kc = 64. For the reaction H₂(g) + I₂(g) ⇌ 2HI(g), the equilibrium constant expression is: Kc = [HI]²/([H₂][I₂]). Substituting the equilibrium concentrations: Kc = (1.6)²/((0.2)(0.2)) = 2.56/(0.04) = 64. Key points: (1) Products (HI) in numerator with exponent matching coefficient (2), (2) Reactants (H₂, I₂) in denominator with exponents matching their coefficients (both 1), (3) All concentrations are at equilibrium, not initial values, (4) Kc is dimensionless when Δn = 0 (here: 2 - 2 = 0). A large Kc value (64 >> 1) indicates the equilibrium strongly favors products - at this temperature, HI formation is favored. If Kc >> 1, equilibrium lies to the right (products); if Kc << 1, equilibrium lies to the left (reactants); if Kc ≈ 1, comparable amounts of reactants and products.'

  question: What happens to the equilibrium constant Kc when the temperature of an exothermic reaction increases?
  options:
  - Kc increases
  - Kc decreases
  - Kc remains constant
  - Cannot be determined without pressure data
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Kc decreases
  explanation: 'For an exothermic reaction, Kc decreases when temperature increases. According to Le Chatelier''s principle and the van''t Hoff equation, when an exothermic reaction releases heat (ΔH < 0), increasing temperature shifts equilibrium toward reactants (backward direction), decreasing Kc. Conversely, decreasing temperature favors products (forward), increasing Kc. Example: N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g) is exothermic (ΔH = -92 kJ/mol). At 200°C, Kp ≈ 0.65; at 400°C, Kp ≈ 0.016 - Kc decreased ~40×. For endothermic reactions (ΔH > 0), the opposite occurs: Kc increases with temperature. The van''t Hoff equation: ln(K₂/K₁) = -(ΔH/R)(1/T₂ - 1/T₁). Temperature is the ONLY factor that changes K; changing concentration, pressure, or volume changes Q and shifts equilibrium but doesn''t change K itself.'

  question: If the reaction A + B ⇌ C + D has Kc = 100, what is Kc for the reverse reaction C + D ⇌ A + B?
  options:
  - '100'
  - '10'
  - '0.01'
  - '0.001'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '0.01'
  explanation: 'For the reverse reaction, Kc = 0.01. The equilibrium constant for a reverse reaction is the reciprocal of the forward reaction: K_reverse = 1/K_forward. If K_forward = 100, then K_reverse = 1/100 = 0.01. This makes sense mathematically: For A + B ⇌ C + D: K_f = [C][D]/[A][B] = 100. For C + D ⇌ A + B: K_r = [A][B]/[C][D] = 1/100 = 0.01. Notice that K_f × K_r = 100 × 0.01 = 1 (always true). Important relationships: (1) Reverse reaction: K'' = 1/K, (2) Multiply equation by n: K'' = K^n (e.g., if A ⇌ B has K = 4, then 2A ⇌ 2B has K = 4² = 16), (3) Add reactions: multiply their K values. These relationships allow manipulation of equilibrium expressions to solve complex problems.'
