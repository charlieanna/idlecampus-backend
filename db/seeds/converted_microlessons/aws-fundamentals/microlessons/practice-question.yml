  question: What is the primary benefit of using cloud computing services like AWS?
  options:
  - On-demand access to computing resources with pay-as-you-go pricing, eliminating
    upfront infrastructure costs
  - Cloud services are always free to use
  - Cloud eliminates the need for system administrators
  - Cloud resources are slower than on-premises hardware
  correct_answer: On-demand access to computing resources with pay-as-you-go pricing,
    eliminating upfront infrastructure costs
  explanation: 'Cloud computing revolutionizes IT infrastructure by providing on-demand
    access to computing resources without large capital investments. Traditional on-premises:
    Buy servers upfront ($10K-$100K+), wait weeks for delivery and setup, pay for
    capacity you don''t use (over-provisioning), difficult to scale up/down, responsible
    for hardware maintenance, refresh cycle every 3-5 years. AWS cloud model: Launch
    resources in minutes via API/Console, pay only for what you use (per hour/second),
    scale up during traffic spikes, scale down to save money, no hardware maintenance
    (AWS handles it), access latest hardware without capital expense. Cost comparison
    example: Startup needs 10 servers. On-premises: $50K upfront + $10K/year maintenance
    = high barrier. AWS: $0 upfront, $300/month when needed, $0 when not - pay $3,600/year
    first year vs $60K on-premises. Elasticity benefits: E-commerce site needs 2 servers
    normally, 20 servers during Black Friday. On-premises: Buy 20 servers, 18 sit
    idle 360 days/year (wasted money). AWS: Run 2 servers daily ($60/month), scale
    to 20 for 1 week ($50 spike), total $660/month vs $600/month for unused on-premises
    capacity. Other advantages: Global reach (deploy in 33 regions), innovation speed
    (use new services immediately), reliability (AWS SLA 99.99%), security (AWS invests
    billions in security). Use cases: Startups (avoid upfront costs), enterprises
    (hybrid cloud for burst capacity), SaaS companies (multi-tenant efficiency), development
    (spin up/destroy test environments). Not suitable for: Extremely latency-sensitive
    (microsecond requirements), strict data residency beyond AWS regions, applications
    requiring specialized hardware AWS doesn''t offer.'
