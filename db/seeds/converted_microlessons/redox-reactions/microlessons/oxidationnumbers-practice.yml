  question: 'What is the oxidation number of sulfur (S) in S₂O₃²⁻ (thiosulfate ion)?'
  options:
  - +1
  - +2
  - +4
  - +6
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: +2
  explanation: 'The average oxidation number of sulfur in S₂O₃²⁻ is +2. Calculation: Let oxidation number of S = x. Formula: 2x + 3(-2) = -2 (total charge on ion). 2x - 6 = -2. 2x = 4. x = +2. Important note: This +2 is the AVERAGE oxidation number. In reality, thiosulfate has two sulfur atoms with different oxidation states: central S = +6, terminal S = -2, giving average = (+6-2)/2 = +2. However, for calculation purposes, we use the average. Verification: 2(+2) + 3(-2) = +4 - 6 = -2 ✓. Rules used: (1) Oxygen in compounds = -2 (except peroxides), (2) Sum of oxidation numbers = charge on ion. Examples of other sulfur oxidation states: S in H₂S = -2, S in SO₂ = +4, S in SO₃ = +6, S in H₂SO₄ = +6, S in S₈ = 0. Thiosulfate is used in photography (fixing agent) and analytical chemistry (iodometric titrations).'

  question: 'What is the oxidation number of chromium (Cr) in Cr₂O₇²⁻ (dichromate ion)?'
  options:
  - +3
  - +4
  - +6
  - +7
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: +6
  explanation: 'The oxidation number of chromium in Cr₂O₇²⁻ is +6. Calculation: Let oxidation number of Cr = x. Formula: 2x + 7(-2) = -2 (total charge). 2x - 14 = -2. 2x = 12. x = +6. This +6 is the highest common oxidation state for chromium. Verification: 2(+6) + 7(-2) = +12 - 14 = -2 ✓. In redox reactions, Cr₂O₇²⁻ is a strong oxidizing agent in acidic medium: Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 14H⁺ + 6e⁻ → 2Cr³⁺ + 7H₂O (Cr: +6 → +3, gain of 3 electrons per Cr atom). Common chromium oxidation states: Cr in CrO₄²⁻ (chromate) = +6, Cr in Cr³⁺ = +3, Cr in Cr²⁺ = +2, Cr in Cr metal = 0. The +6 state is stable in oxyanions (CrO₄²⁻ yellow, Cr₂O₇²⁻ orange). Dichromate-chromate equilibrium: 2CrO₄²⁻ + 2H⁺ ⇌ Cr₂O₇²⁻ + H₂O (both have Cr in +6 state). Dichromate is used in volumetric analysis and as oxidizing agent in organic chemistry.'

  question: 'In which compound does nitrogen have the HIGHEST oxidation number?'
  options:
  - NH₃
  - N₂O₄
  - HNO₃
  - NO
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: HNO₃
  explanation: 'Nitrogen has the highest oxidation number (+5) in HNO₃ (nitric acid). Calculations: (1) NH₃: Let N = x. x + 3(+1) = 0 → x = -3, (2) N₂O₄: Let N = x. 2x + 4(-2) = 0 → 2x = 8 → x = +4, (3) HNO₃: Let N = x. +1 + x + 3(-2) = 0 → 1 + x - 6 = 0 → x = +5, (4) NO: Let N = x. x + (-2) = 0 → x = +2. Oxidation number comparison: NH₃ (-3) < NO (+2) < N₂O₄ (+4) < HNO₃ (+5). The highest is HNO₃ at +5. Nitrogen oxidation states range from -3 to +5: N in NH₃ = -3 (most reduced), N in N₂H₄ = -2, N in NH₂OH = -1, N in N₂ = 0, N in N₂O = +1, N in NO = +2, N in N₂O₃ = +3, N in NO₂/N₂O₄ = +4, N in HNO₃/NO₃⁻ = +5 (most oxidized). The +5 state in nitric acid makes it a strong oxidizing agent used in many industrial processes and laboratory preparations.'
