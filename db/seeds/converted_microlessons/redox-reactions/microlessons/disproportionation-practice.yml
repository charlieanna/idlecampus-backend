  TRUE. Cl in Cl₂ (ON = 0) goes to both Cl⁻ (ON = -1, reduced) and ClO₃⁻ (ON = +5,
  oxidized). Same element simultaneously oxidized and reduced.


  ## Key Points

  question: 'Is the reaction 3Cl₂ + 6OH⁻ → 5Cl⁻ + ClO₃⁻ + 3H₂O a disproportionation reaction?'
  options:
  - 'Yes'
  - 'No'
  - Cannot be determined
  - Only at high temperature
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 'Yes'
  explanation: 'YES, this is a disproportionation reaction. In disproportionation, the same element undergoes both oxidation and reduction simultaneously. Analysis: Chlorine in Cl₂ has oxidation number 0. Products: (1) Cl⁻: oxidation number = -1 (REDUCTION: 0 → -1, gain of electrons), (2) ClO₃⁻: Cl has oxidation number = +5 (OXIDATION: 0 → +5, loss of electrons). The same element (Cl) is simultaneously oxidized to +5 and reduced to -1. Balanced equation shows: 5 Cl atoms reduced (5Cl⁻) and 1 Cl atom oxidized (ClO₃⁻), totaling 6 Cl atoms from 3Cl₂. Other examples of disproportionation: (1) 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂ (O: -1 → -2 and 0), (2) 3Cl₂ + 6NaOH → 5NaCl + NaClO₃ + 3H₂O (same as given), (3) P₄ + 3NaOH + 3H₂O → 3NaH₂PO₂ + PH₃ (P: 0 → +1 and -3). These reactions are also called auto-redox reactions.'

  question: 'Which reaction represents a disproportionation?'
  options:
  - 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂
  - Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu
  - 2KClO₃ → 2KCl + 3O₂
  - Fe + S → FeS
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂
  explanation: '2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂ is a disproportionation reaction. Oxidation state analysis: In H₂O₂, oxygen = -1. Products: H₂O (oxygen = -2, REDUCED), O₂ (oxygen = 0, OXIDIZED). The same element (oxygen) is simultaneously oxidized (-1 → 0) and reduced (-1 → -2). Analysis of other reactions: (1) Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu: Zn oxidized (0 → +2), Cu reduced (+2 → 0) - different elements, NOT disproportionation, (2) 2KClO₃ → 2KCl + 3O₂: Only oxygen changes: +5 → -1 (Cl reduced), -2 → 0 (O oxidized) - different elements changing, NOT disproportionation, (3) Fe + S → FeS: Simple combination, NOT redox. Key to identifying disproportionation: (1) Single element must be both oxidized AND reduced, (2) That element appears in products with at least two different oxidation states, (3) Both oxidation states differ from the reactant state.'

  question: 'In which medium does Cl₂ undergo disproportionation to form Cl⁻ and ClO₃⁻?'
  options:
  - Acidic medium
  - Basic/Alkaline medium
  - Neutral medium
  - Any medium
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Basic/Alkaline medium
  explanation: 'Chlorine undergoes disproportionation in BASIC (alkaline) medium to form Cl⁻ and ClO₃⁻. Reactions in different media: (1) Hot concentrated base: 3Cl₂ + 6OH⁻ → 5Cl⁻ + ClO₃⁻ + 3H₂O (Cl: 0 → -1 and +5), (2) Cold dilute base: Cl₂ + 2OH⁻ → Cl⁻ + ClO⁻ + H₂O (Cl: 0 → -1 and +1, also disproportionation), (3) Neutral/acidic medium: Disproportionation does NOT occur or occurs differently. Why base is needed: OH⁻ ions stabilize the oxidized products (ClO⁻, ClO₃⁻) by neutralizing acidic character. In acid, Cl₂ primarily acts as oxidizing agent without significant disproportionation. Practical applications: Chlorine disproportionation in base produces bleaching agents (hypochlorite ClO⁻ in household bleach, chlorate ClO₃⁻). Temperature matters: Cold base → ClO⁻ (hypochlorite), Hot base → ClO₃⁻ (chlorate). This is used industrially to manufacture bleaching powder and sodium chlorate.'
