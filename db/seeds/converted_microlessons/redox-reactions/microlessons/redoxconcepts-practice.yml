  Oxidizing agent gets reduced. Cu²⁺ gains electrons (reduced from +2 to 0), so Cu²⁺
  is the oxidizing agent.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'In the reaction Zn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu, the oxidizing agent is:'
  options:
  - Zn
  - Cu²⁺
  - Zn²⁺
  - Cu
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Cu²⁺
  explanation: 'In the reaction Zn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu, the oxidizing agent is the
    species that gets reduced (gains electrons). Cu²⁺ gains 2 electrons to become
    Cu (oxidation state changes from +2 to 0), so Cu²⁺ is the oxidizing agent. The
    oxidizing agent oxidizes another species (Zn is oxidized from 0 to +2) while itself
    being reduced. Conversely, Zn is the reducing agent because it loses electrons
    (gets oxidized) while reducing Cu²⁺. Remember: oxidizing agent = gets reduced,
    reducing agent = gets oxidized.'

  question: 'Which process occurs at the anode in an electrochemical cell?'
  options:
  - Reduction
  - Oxidation
  - Neutralization
  - Precipitation
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Oxidation
  explanation: 'Oxidation occurs at the ANODE in an electrochemical cell. Memory aid: "AN OX" (Anode = Oxidation). At the anode: (1) Electrons are LOST (oxidation), (2) Electrons flow FROM the anode to external circuit, (3) Anode is negative terminal in galvanic/voltaic cells, (4) Anode is positive terminal in electrolytic cells. At the cathode (opposite electrode): (1) Reduction occurs (electrons GAINED), (2) Electrons flow TO the cathode from external circuit, (3) Cathode is positive in galvanic cells, negative in electrolytic cells. Memory aids: "AN OX, RED CAT" (Anode Oxidation, Reduction Cathode). Example - Daniell cell: Anode (Zn): Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻ (oxidation, Zn loses electrons); Cathode (Cu): Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu (reduction, Cu²⁺ gains electrons). Understanding electrode processes is crucial for: battery operation, electroplating, corrosion prevention, and electrolysis.'

  question: 'Which statement about redox reactions is CORRECT?'
  options:
  - Oxidation and reduction always occur together
  - Oxidation involves gain of electrons
  - Reducing agent gets reduced
  - Oxidation number increases during reduction
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Oxidation and reduction always occur together
  explanation: '"Oxidation and reduction always occur together" is CORRECT. Redox reactions are coupled - when one species loses electrons (oxidation), another must gain them (reduction). Electrons cannot exist freely in solution. Analysis of other statements: (1) "Oxidation involves gain of electrons" - FALSE. Oxidation is LOSS of electrons (OIL: Oxidation Is Loss). Reduction is gain of electrons (RIG: Reduction Is Gain), (2) "Reducing agent gets reduced" - FALSE. The reducing agent CAUSES reduction in another species while ITSELF getting oxidized. It loses electrons, (3) "Oxidation number increases during reduction" - FALSE. Oxidation number DECREASES during reduction (gains electrons, becomes more negative). Increases during oxidation. Fundamental redox concepts: LEO says GER (Lose Electrons = Oxidation, Gain Electrons = Reduction); Oxidizing agent: causes oxidation, gets reduced; Reducing agent: causes reduction, gets oxidized. Examples: In Zn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu: Zn oxidized (0 → +2), Cu²⁺ reduced (+2 → 0), both occur simultaneously.'
