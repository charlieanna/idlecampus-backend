  H₂O₂ acts as a reducing agent when it reduces strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄,
  producing O₂: H₂O₂ → O₂ + 2H⁺ + 2e⁻. In the other reactions, H₂O₂ acts as an oxidizing
  agent.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: In which of the following reactions does H₂O₂ act as a reducing agent?
  options:
  - H₂O₂ + 2Fe²⁺ + 2H⁺ → 2Fe³⁺ + 2H₂O
  - H₂O₂ + 2I⁻ + 2H⁺ → I₂ + 2H₂O
  - 2KMnO₄ + 3H₂SO₄ + 5H₂O₂ → K₂SO₄ + 2MnSO₄ + 8H₂O + 5O₂
  - PbS + 4H₂O₂ → PbSO₄ + 4H₂O
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 2KMnO₄ + 3H₂SO₄ + 5H₂O₂ → K₂SO₄ + 2MnSO₄ + 8H₂O + 5O₂
  explanation: 'In this reaction with KMnO₄ (a strong oxidizing agent), H₂O₂ acts
    as a reducing agent. H₂O₂ is oxidized to O₂ while reducing Mn⁺⁷ (in KMnO₄) to
    Mn⁺² (in MnSO₄): H₂O₂ → O₂ + 2H⁺ + 2e⁻. In contrast, in the other reactions: (1)
    With Fe²⁺: H₂O₂ acts as oxidizing agent, oxidizing Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺. (2) With I⁻:
    H₂O₂ oxidizes I⁻ to I₂. (3) With PbS: H₂O₂ oxidizes S⁻² to S⁺⁶ (PbSO₄). H₂O₂''s
    dual behavior (both oxidizing and reducing) occurs because oxygen in H₂O₂ has
    an intermediate oxidation state (-1), which can be reduced to -2 (H₂O) or oxidized
    to 0 (O₂).'

  question: What is the oxidation state of oxygen in H₂O₂?
  options:
  - '-2'
  - '-1'
  - '0'
  - '+1'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '-1'
  explanation: 'In hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), oxygen has an unusual oxidation state
    of -1. This is intermediate between O in H₂O (-2) and O₂ (0). The -1 state makes
    H₂O₂ capable of both oxidation and reduction (disproportionation). Structure:
    H-O-O-H with O-O single bond. Each O has: +1 from H bond, -1 from O-O bond (shared
    equally), Net = -1. This dual nature allows: As oxidizing agent: O goes from
    -1 to -2 (gains electrons), e.g., H₂O₂ + 2I⁻ + 2H⁺ → I₂ + 2H₂O. As reducing agent:
    O goes from -1 to 0 (loses electrons), e.g., H₂O₂ + 2Fe³⁺ → O₂ + 2Fe²⁺ + 2H⁺
    (no, this is wrong - let me reconsider). Actually as reducing: H₂O₂ + KMnO₄ →
    O₂ + products.'

  question: Which compound is used as a stabilizer to prevent decomposition of H₂O₂?
  options:
  - Sodium chloride
  - Urea or phosphoric acid
  - Potassium permanganate
  - Hydrogen sulfide
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Urea or phosphoric acid
  explanation: 'Urea, phosphoric acid, or acetanilide are added as stabilizers to
    prevent decomposition of H₂O₂. H₂O₂ is unstable and slowly decomposes: 2H₂O₂
    → 2H₂O + O₂ (exothermic, ΔH = -98 kJ/mol). Decomposition is catalyzed by: (1)
    Heavy metal ions (Fe³⁺, Cu²⁺, Mn²⁺), (2) Alkaline conditions, (3) Light, (4)
    Heat. Stabilizers work by: Complexing trace metal impurities, Maintaining slightly
    acidic pH (pH 3-4 is most stable). Storage: H₂O₂ must be stored in dark bottles
    (prevents photodecomposition), plastic or wax-lined glass containers (glass has
    metal impurities), cool conditions, without metal caps. Concentrated H₂O₂ (>50%)
    can decompose explosively if contaminated.'
