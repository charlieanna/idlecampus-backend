  Hydrogen fuel cells convert chemical energy directly to electrical energy through
  electrochemical reactions. At the anode: H₂ → 2H⁺ + 2e⁻, and at the cathode: O₂
  + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O. The overall process produces water and electrical energy with
  high efficiency (60-80%).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: In a hydrogen fuel cell, what type of energy is produced?
  options:
  - Heat energy only
  - Electrical energy
  - Nuclear energy
  - Mechanical energy
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Electrical energy
  explanation: 'Hydrogen fuel cells convert chemical energy directly to electrical
    energy through electrochemical reactions. Process: At anode (oxidation): H₂ →
    2H⁺ + 2e⁻, At cathode (reduction): O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O, Overall: 2H₂ + O₂ →
    2H₂O + electrical energy. Efficiency: 60-80% (much higher than combustion engines
    at ~25%). Advantages: (1) Clean - only byproduct is water, (2) High efficiency,
    (3) Quiet operation, (4) No moving parts. Applications: Vehicle power, stationary
    power generation, portable electronics. Types: PEM (Polymer Electrolyte Membrane),
    SOFC (Solid Oxide), AFC (Alkaline).'

  question: What happens at the cathode in a hydrogen fuel cell?
  options:
  - H₂ is oxidized to H⁺
  - O₂ is reduced to H₂O
  - H₂O is decomposed to H₂ and O₂
  - Electrons are released
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: O₂ is reduced to H₂O
  explanation: 'At the cathode (positive electrode) of a hydrogen fuel cell, oxygen
    is reduced to water. Half-reaction: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O. The O₂ molecules accept
    electrons (reduction) that flow through external circuit from anode. The H⁺ ions
    migrate through electrolyte membrane from anode to cathode. At anode (negative
    electrode): H₂ → 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ (oxidation). The electrons flow through external circuit
    doing electrical work, while protons migrate through membrane. Remember: OIL RIG
    - Oxidation Is Loss (anode), Reduction Is Gain (cathode).'

  question: What is the main advantage of hydrogen fuel cells over combustion engines?
  options:
  - Lower cost of hydrogen fuel
  - Higher energy efficiency (60-80% vs ~25%)
  - Faster refueling time
  - No need for oxygen
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Higher energy efficiency (60-80% vs ~25%)
  explanation: 'The main advantage of hydrogen fuel cells is their much higher energy
    efficiency (60-80%) compared to internal combustion engines (~25%). This is because
    fuel cells directly convert chemical energy to electrical energy without intermediate
    combustion step (avoiding Carnot efficiency limit). Other advantages: (1) Zero
    emissions - only byproduct is pure water, (2) Quiet operation - no combustion/moving
    pistons, (3) Scalable - can be sized for any application, (4) Quick start-up.
    Challenges: (1) High cost of fuel cells, (2) Hydrogen storage/distribution infrastructure,
    (3) Production of H₂ (currently mainly from fossil fuels). Future: Green hydrogen
    from water electrolysis using renewable energy.'
