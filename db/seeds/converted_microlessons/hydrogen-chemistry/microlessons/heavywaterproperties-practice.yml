  D₂O is used as a moderator in nuclear reactors (slows neutrons), has higher density
  (1.11 g/mL) than H₂O (1.0 g/mL), is toxic to living organisms, and reacts slower
  than H₂O due to kinetic isotope effect.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the density of heavy water (D₂O) at room temperature?
  options:
  - 0.92 g/mL
  - 1.00 g/mL
  - 1.11 g/mL
  - 1.25 g/mL
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 1.11 g/mL
  explanation: 'Heavy water (D₂O) has a density of 1.11 g/mL at 25°C, which is about
    11% higher than normal water (1.00 g/mL). This is because deuterium atoms (mass
    = 2 amu) are twice as heavy as protium atoms (mass = 1 amu), making D₂O molecules
    heavier. Molecular weight: D₂O = 20 g/mol vs H₂O = 18 g/mol. The higher density
    causes ice made from D₂O to sink in normal water (unusual property). Other physical
    properties affected by mass: Temperature of maximum density (11.6°C vs 4°C), Viscosity
    (higher for D₂O), Refractive index (slightly different).'

  question: Why does heavy water (D₂O) react slower than normal water (H₂O)?
  options:
  - D₂O has lower density
  - Kinetic isotope effect - D-O bonds are stronger
  - D₂O has weaker hydrogen bonding
  - D₂O is less polar than H₂O
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Kinetic isotope effect - D-O bonds are stronger
  explanation: 'D₂O reacts slower than H₂O due to the kinetic isotope effect. D-O
    bonds are stronger and have lower zero-point vibrational energy than H-O bonds
    because deuterium is heavier. Breaking D-O bonds requires more energy, so reactions
    involving bond cleavage are slower. The rate ratio k(H₂O)/k(D₂O) can be 2-10
    for reactions involving O-H/O-D bond breaking. Examples: Deuterolysis (reaction
    with D₂O) is slower than hydrolysis, Acid-base reactions in D₂O are slower. This
    property is useful in mechanistic studies - if replacing H with D significantly
    slows reaction, it indicates H is involved in rate-determining step.'

  question: Which statement about heavy water (D₂O) toxicity is correct?
  options:
  - D₂O is completely safe for human consumption
  - D₂O is toxic because it disrupts cellular processes
  - D₂O is more toxic than cyanide
  - D₂O has no biological effects
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: D₂O is toxic because it disrupts cellular processes
  explanation: 'Heavy water (D₂O) is toxic to living organisms because it disrupts
    cellular processes when it replaces normal water (H₂O) in cells. Effects: (1)
    Enzyme reactions slow down due to kinetic isotope effect, (2) DNA replication
    and cell division are affected, (3) Metabolic pathways are disrupted. Toxicity
    depends on concentration: 25% D₂O replacement - noticeable effects on cell division,
    50% D₂O - severe metabolic disruption in mammals, >70% D₂O - can be lethal. Small
    amounts are not immediately harmful - a glass of D₂O won''t kill you, but it''s
    not recommended. Eukaryotic cells are more sensitive than prokaryotes. D₂O is
    used in research to study metabolic processes and cell division.'
