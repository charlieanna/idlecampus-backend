  Heavy water (D₂O) has a boiling point of 101.4°C, which is higher than normal water
  (100°C) due to stronger hydrogen bonding caused by the heavier deuterium atoms.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: What is the boiling point of heavy water (D₂O)?
  options:
  - 98.5°C
  - 100.0°C
  - 101.4°C
  - 105.0°C
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 101.4°C
  explanation: 'Heavy water (D₂O) has a boiling point of 101.4°C, which is higher
    than normal water (100°C). This is due to stronger hydrogen bonding in D₂O caused
    by the heavier deuterium atoms. Deuterium has mass 2 amu compared to protium (1
    amu), so D₂O molecules have greater mass and stronger intermolecular forces. Other
    properties of D₂O vs H₂O: Melting point: 3.82°C vs 0°C, Density: 1.11 g/mL vs
    1.00 g/mL, Maximum density at: 11.6°C vs 4°C. The differences arise from the mass
    difference between isotopes affecting zero-point vibrational energy and bond strength.'

  question: Heavy water (D₂O) is primarily used in which application?
  options:
  - As drinking water
  - As a moderator in nuclear reactors
  - As a catalyst in organic reactions
  - As a refrigerant
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: As a moderator in nuclear reactors
  explanation: 'Heavy water (D₂O) is primarily used as a moderator in nuclear reactors
    to slow down fast neutrons without absorbing them. D₂O is better than H₂O because
    deuterium has very low neutron absorption cross-section, allowing more neutrons
    to be available for fission. Process: Fast neutrons from fission collide with
    D₂O molecules, losing kinetic energy and becoming thermal neutrons that can sustain
    chain reaction. CANDU reactors use D₂O moderator. Other uses: Tracer in chemical/biological
    studies, NMR spectroscopy solvent. D₂O is toxic to living organisms - replaces
    H₂O in cells, disrupting metabolism.'

  question: How is heavy water (D₂O) commercially produced?
  options:
  - Electrolysis of water
  - Fractional distillation of ordinary water
  - Girdler sulfide process
  - Direct synthesis from D₂ and O₂
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Girdler sulfide process
  explanation: 'Heavy water is commercially produced by the Girdler sulfide (GS) process,
    which exploits the different exchange equilibria of hydrogen isotopes between
    H₂S and H₂O at different temperatures. The process uses two-temperature exchange:
    Cold tower (30°C) and hot tower (130°C). Deuterium preferentially concentrates
    in H₂O in cold tower and in H₂S in hot tower. By cycling H₂S between towers,
    D₂O is gradually enriched. Natural abundance of D is only 0.015% in water, so
    large amounts of H₂O must be processed. Other methods: Electrolysis (water containing
    D₂O is harder to electrolyze, so D₂O concentrates), Fractional distillation (based
    on b.p. difference, but inefficient). Modern plants produce 99.8% pure D₂O.'
