    question: "Which of the following hydrides is classified as electron-deficient and contains unusual bonding?"
    options:
      - "NH₃ (ammonia)"
      - "CH₄ (methane)"
      - "B₂H₆ (diborane)"
      - "H₂O (water)"
    correct_answer: "B₂H₆ (diborane)"
    explanation: "Diborane (B₂H₆) is the classic example of an electron-deficient hydride. In electron-deficient hydrides, the central atom does not have enough electrons to form normal two-center two-electron (2c-2e) bonds with all surrounding atoms. Boron has only 3 valence electrons but forms bonds with multiple hydrogen atoms in diborane. The unique structure of B₂H₆ features four terminal hydrogen atoms bonded normally to boron atoms, and two bridging hydrogen atoms that connect the two boron atoms through three-center two-electron (3c-2e) bonds, also called banana bonds or bridge bonds. Each 3c-2e bond involves two electrons delocalized over three atoms (two borons and one hydrogen). This unusual bonding arises because boron has an incomplete octet. In contrast, CH₄ is electron-precise (complete octet, tetrahedral, no lone pairs), while NH₃ and H₂O are electron-rich hydrides (central atom has lone pairs: NH₃ has one lone pair, H₂O has two lone pairs). These electron-rich hydrides can act as Lewis bases due to available lone pairs."

    question: "Hard water containing Ca(HCO₃)₂ and CaSO₄ is treated first by boiling and then with washing soda (Na₂CO₃). What types of hardness are removed by each step?"
    options:
      - "Boiling removes permanent hardness; Na₂CO₃ removes temporary hardness"
      - "Boiling removes temporary hardness; Na₂CO₃ removes permanent hardness"
      - "Both steps remove the same type of hardness"
      - "Boiling removes both types; Na₂CO₃ is not needed"
    correct_answer: "Boiling removes temporary hardness; Na₂CO₃ removes permanent hardness"
    explanation: "Water hardness is classified into two types based on the salts present and removal method. Temporary hardness (carbonate hardness) is caused by dissolved bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium: Ca(HCO₃)₂ and Mg(HCO₃)₂. It is called 'temporary' because it can be removed by simple boiling. When heated, bicarbonates decompose: Ca(HCO₃)₂ → CaCO₃↓ + H₂O + CO₂↑. The insoluble calcium carbonate precipitates out, removing the hardness. Permanent hardness (non-carbonate hardness) is caused by dissolved sulfates and chlorides of calcium and magnesium: CaSO₄, MgSO₄, CaCl₂, MgCl₂. These salts do not decompose on boiling, hence the hardness persists. Permanent hardness requires chemical treatment for removal. Washing soda (Na₂CO₃) effectively removes permanent hardness by precipitating the calcium and magnesium salts: CaSO₄ + Na₂CO₃ → CaCO₃↓ + Na₂SO₄. The insoluble carbonate precipitates are filtered out. Other methods for removing permanent hardness include ion-exchange (zeolite/permutit method) and the Calgon method using sodium hexametaphosphate."

    question: "Why is heavy water (D₂O) used as a moderator in nuclear reactors instead of ordinary water (H₂O)?"
    options:
      - "D₂O has a higher boiling point and can operate at higher temperatures"
      - "D₂O slows down neutrons effectively without absorbing them, unlike H₂O which absorbs neutrons"
      - "D₂O is chemically more stable than H₂O under radiation"
      - "D₂O produces more energy when used in nuclear reactions"
    correct_answer: "D₂O slows down neutrons effectively without absorbing them, unlike H₂O which absorbs neutrons"
    explanation: "The role of a moderator in a nuclear reactor is to slow down fast neutrons produced by fission to thermal energies (slow neutrons) because slow neutrons are more likely to cause further fission reactions in uranium-235, sustaining the chain reaction. An ideal moderator should: (1) effectively slow down neutrons through elastic collisions, and (2) have a very low tendency to absorb neutrons. Light nuclei are most effective at slowing neutrons because momentum transfer is maximum when colliding particles have similar masses. Both H₂O and D₂O contain light nuclei and can slow neutrons. However, the critical difference is neutron absorption: ordinary hydrogen (¹H) has a relatively high neutron absorption cross-section. When ¹H absorbs a neutron, it forms deuterium: ¹H + n → ²H + γ. This removes neutrons from the chain reaction. Deuterium (²H in D₂O) has a much lower neutron absorption cross-section – about 500 times lower than ¹H. Therefore, D₂O slows neutrons effectively while absorbing very few, making it an excellent moderator. This property allows reactors using D₂O to operate with natural uranium fuel rather than requiring enriched uranium, as needed with H₂O moderated reactors."
