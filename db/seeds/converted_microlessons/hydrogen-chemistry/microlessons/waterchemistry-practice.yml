  Temporary hardness is caused by bicarbonates Ca(HCO₃)₂ and Mg(HCO₃)₂, which decompose
  on boiling: Ca(HCO₃)₂ → CaCO₃↓ + H₂O + CO₂↑. Washing soda and ion exchange remove
  permanent hardness.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: 'Temporary hardness of water can be removed by:'
  options:
  - Boiling
  - Adding washing soda
  - Ion exchange method
  - Distillation
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Boiling
  explanation: 'Temporary hardness of water can be removed by boiling. Temporary hardness
    is caused by dissolved bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium [Ca(HCO₃)₂ and Mg(HCO₃)₂].
    When water is boiled, these bicarbonates decompose to form insoluble carbonates
    that precipitate out: Ca(HCO₃)₂ → CaCO₃↓ + H₂O + CO₂↑ and Mg(HCO₃)₂ → MgCO₃↓ +
    H₂O + CO₂↑. This precipitates the hardness-causing ions, softening the water.
    This method ONLY works for temporary hardness, not permanent hardness (caused
    by sulfates/chlorides of Ca/Mg). Permanent hardness requires other methods: washing
    soda (Na₂CO₃), ion exchange resins, or synthetic zeolites. Distillation removes
    both types but is energy-intensive.'

  question: Which compounds cause permanent hardness of water?
  options:
  - Calcium bicarbonate and magnesium bicarbonate
  - Calcium sulfate and magnesium chloride
  - Sodium chloride and potassium chloride
  - Calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Calcium sulfate and magnesium chloride
  explanation: 'Permanent hardness is caused by sulfates and chlorides of calcium
    and magnesium (CaSO₄, MgSO₄, CaCl₂, MgCl₂). Unlike bicarbonates, these salts
    do NOT decompose on boiling, so hardness persists. Removal methods: (1) Washing
    soda (Na₂CO₃): CaSO₄ + Na₂CO₃ → CaCO₃↓ + Na₂SO₄, precipitates Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ as carbonates.
    (2) Ion exchange (Permutit/Zeolite method): 2NaZ + Ca²⁺ → CaZ₂ + 2Na⁺, replaces
    Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ with Na⁺. Regeneration: CaZ₂ + 2NaCl → 2NaZ + CaCl₂. (3) Synthetic
    resins (demineralization). Temporary hardness (bicarbonates) can be removed by
    simple boiling. Total hardness = Temporary + Permanent, measured in ppm or mg/L
    as CaCO₃ equivalent.'

  question: What is the principle of ion exchange method for removing water hardness?
  options:
  - Precipitating Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ as carbonates
  - Replacing Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ with Na⁺ ions
  - Decomposing bicarbonates by heating
  - Distilling water to remove all salts
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Replacing Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ with Na⁺ ions
  explanation: 'Ion exchange method removes hardness by replacing hardness-causing
    Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ ions with Na⁺ ions using zeolites (permutits) or synthetic resins.
    Process: Hard water is passed through a column containing sodium zeolite (Na₂Z).
    Exchange reactions: Na₂Z + Ca²⁺ → CaZ + 2Na⁺, Na₂Z + Mg²⁺ → MgZ + 2Na⁺. The Na⁺
    ions released don''t cause hardness. When zeolite is exhausted (all Na⁺ exchanged),
    it''s regenerated by passing concentrated NaCl solution: CaZ + 2NaCl → Na₂Z +
    CaCl₂ (washed away). Advantages: (1) Removes both temporary and permanent hardness,
    (2) Continuous process, (3) No chemicals needed except for regeneration. Disadvantage:
    Increases Na⁺ concentration (unsuitable for drinking if on low-sodium diet).'
