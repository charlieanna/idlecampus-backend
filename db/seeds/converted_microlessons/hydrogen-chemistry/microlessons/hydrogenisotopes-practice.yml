  Tritium (³H or T) is the radioactive isotope of hydrogen with a half-life of 12.3
  years. It is a beta emitter: ³H → ³He + β⁻. Protium and deuterium are stable.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: Which isotope of hydrogen is radioactive?
  options:
  - Protium
  - Deuterium
  - Tritium
  - All isotopes are radioactive
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Tritium
  explanation: 'Tritium (³H or T) is the radioactive isotope of hydrogen. It has 1
    proton and 2 neutrons (mass number = 3) and undergoes beta decay with a half-life
    of 12.3 years: ³H → ³He + β⁻ + ν̄ₑ. In contrast, protium (¹H, ~99.98% natural
    abundance) and deuterium (²H or D, ~0.015% abundance) are stable isotopes. Tritium
    occurs naturally in trace amounts from cosmic ray interactions but is primarily
    produced artificially in nuclear reactors: ⁶Li + n → ³H + ⁴He. Uses of tritium
    include: nuclear fusion research, self-luminous devices (exit signs), radioactive
    tracers, and thermonuclear weapons. Due to radioactivity, tritiated water (HTO
    or T₂O) poses health risks if ingested.'

  question: What is the natural abundance of deuterium in hydrogen?
  options:
  - 99.98%
  - 0.015%
  - 0.0001%
  - 10%
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 0.015%
  explanation: 'Deuterium (²H or D) has a natural abundance of approximately 0.015%
    (1 in 6,700 hydrogen atoms). Protium (¹H) is the most abundant at ~99.985%, while
    tritium (³H) exists only in trace amounts (~10⁻¹⁸%). Isotope properties: Protium:
    1 proton, 0 neutrons, mass = 1 amu, Deuterium: 1 proton, 1 neutron, mass = 2
    amu, Tritium: 1 proton, 2 neutrons, mass = 3 amu. Despite low abundance, deuterium
    is concentrated from water to produce heavy water (D₂O) used in nuclear reactors.
    Ocean water contains ~0.015% D, meaning 1 liter contains ~0.15 mL D₂O. Commercial
    D₂O production requires processing thousands of liters of water.'

  question: How is tritium (³H) primarily produced for commercial use?
  options:
  - Natural cosmic ray interactions
  - Nuclear fission of uranium
  - Neutron bombardment of lithium-6
  - Electrolysis of heavy water
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Neutron bombardment of lithium-6
  explanation: 'Tritium (³H) is primarily produced artificially by neutron bombardment
    of lithium-6 in nuclear reactors: ⁶Li + n → ³H + ⁴He. This is the main commercial
    production method. Natural tritium production occurs from cosmic ray interactions
    with nitrogen in upper atmosphere: ¹⁴N + n → ³H + ¹²C, but this produces only
    trace amounts (~4 kg globally per year). Tritium has short half-life (12.3 years),
    so natural abundance is very low (~10⁻¹⁸%). Uses: Nuclear fusion fuel (deuterium-tritium
    reactions), Radioactive tracers in hydrology/biochemistry, Self-luminous devices
    (beta emission excites phosphor), Boosted fission weapons. Tritium decays by beta
    emission: ³H → ³He + β⁻.'
