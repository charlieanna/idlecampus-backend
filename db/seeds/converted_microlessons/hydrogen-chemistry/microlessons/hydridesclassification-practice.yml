  Ionic hydrides are formed by highly electropositive s-block metals (Group 1 and
  heavier Group 2 elements). NaH and CaH₂ are ionic hydrides containing H⁻ ion. NH₃
  and SiH₄ are covalent hydrides.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following are ionic hydrides?
  options:
  - NH₃ and CH₄
  - NaH and CaH₂
  - B₂H₆ and AlH₃
  - SiH₄ and PH₃
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: NaH and CaH₂
  explanation: 'Ionic hydrides are formed by highly electropositive s-block metals
    (Group 1 and heavier Group 2 elements like Ca, Sr, Ba). In ionic hydrides, hydrogen
    exists as hydride ion (H⁻) with oxidation state -1. Examples: NaH, KH, CaH₂,
    SrH₂, BaH₂. Properties: (1) Crystalline solids with high melting points, (2)
    Conduct electricity in molten state, (3) Liberate H₂ gas on reaction with water:
    NaH + H₂O → NaOH + H₂↑, CaH₂ + 2H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + 2H₂↑. In contrast: NH₃, CH₄,
    SiH₄, PH₃ are covalent hydrides; B₂H₆, AlH₃ are electron-deficient covalent hydrides.'

  question: What is the oxidation state of hydrogen in ionic hydrides?
  options:
  - '+1'
  - '-1'
  - '0'
  - '+2'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '-1'
  explanation: 'In ionic hydrides (like NaH, CaH₂), hydrogen has oxidation state -1
    because it exists as hydride ion (H⁻). When highly electropositive metals (Na,
    K, Ca) react with hydrogen, they donate electrons to hydrogen forming H⁻ ion:
    Na + 1/2 H₂ → NaH (Na⁺H⁻). The hydride ion H⁻ is isoelectronic with helium (2
    electrons). Properties of H⁻: Large ionic radius (~208 pm), Strong reducing agent,
    Reacts violently with water liberating H₂. This contrasts with covalent hydrides
    where H has +1 oxidation state (bonded to less electronegative elements).'

  question: Which property distinguishes metallic hydrides from ionic hydrides?
  options:
  - Metallic hydrides are non-stoichiometric; ionic hydrides are stoichiometric
  - Metallic hydrides conduct electricity; ionic hydrides do not
  - Metallic hydrides have H in +1 state; ionic hydrides have H in -1 state
  - Metallic hydrides are formed by alkali metals
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Metallic hydrides are non-stoichiometric; ionic hydrides are stoichiometric
  explanation: 'Metallic (interstitial) hydrides are non-stoichiometric - they don''t
    have fixed composition (e.g., PdH₀.₆, TiH₁.₈). Formed by d-block and f-block
    metals where H atoms occupy interstitial positions in metal lattice. Properties:
    (1) Variable composition, (2) Metallic conductivity, (3) Metallic luster, (4)
    Lower density than parent metal. In contrast, ionic hydrides (NaH, CaH₂) are stoichiometric
    with definite composition. Both conduct electricity, but for different reasons:
    metallic hydrides via delocalized electrons, ionic hydrides via ion migration
    in molten state. Ionic hydrides are formed by s-block metals, metallic by d/f-block.'
