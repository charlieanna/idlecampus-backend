  TRUE. Diborane (B₂H₆) is an electron-deficient hydride because boron has only 6
  electrons (incomplete octet). It contains unique 3-center-2-electron bonds (banana
  bonds) involving bridge hydrogen atoms.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: Which of the following is an electron-deficient hydride?
  options:
  - Ammonia (NH₃)
  - Water (H₂O)
  - Diborane (B₂H₆)
  - Methane (CH₄)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Diborane (B₂H₆)
  explanation: 'Diborane (B₂H₆) is an electron-deficient hydride because boron has
    only 6 valence electrons (incomplete octet). It cannot form normal covalent bonds
    with all hydrogen atoms. Structure: Contains unique 3-center-2-electron bonds
    (3c-2e or banana bonds) involving bridge hydrogen atoms. Each boron is bonded
    to 2 terminal H atoms normally and shares 2 bridge H atoms through 3c-2e bonds.
    Other electron-deficient hydrides: Al₂H₆, BeH₂. In contrast: NH₃, H₂O, CH₄ are
    electron-precise hydrides where the central atom has complete octet.'

  question: Which type of covalent hydride can act as Lewis base?
  options:
  - Electron-deficient hydrides like B₂H₆
  - Electron-precise hydrides like CH₄
  - Electron-rich hydrides like NH₃
  - All covalent hydrides
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Electron-rich hydrides like NH₃
  explanation: 'Electron-rich covalent hydrides like NH₃, H₂O, HF can act as Lewis
    bases because they have lone pairs of electrons on the central atom. These lone
    pairs can be donated to electron-deficient species (Lewis acids). Examples: NH₃
    (1 lone pair on N), H₂O (2 lone pairs on O), HF (3 lone pairs on F). These hydrides
    are formed by elements of groups 15, 16, 17. Applications: NH₃ + BF₃ → F₃B←NH₃
    (coordinate bond), H₂O + H⁺ → H₃O⁺. In contrast, electron-precise (CH₄, SiH₄)
    have no lone pairs, and electron-deficient (B₂H₆) need electrons.'

  question: What is the oxidation state of hydrogen in covalent hydrides?
  options:
  - '+1'
  - '-1'
  - '0'
  - Variable
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '+1'
  explanation: 'In covalent hydrides, hydrogen has oxidation state +1 because it is
    bonded to less electronegative elements (B, C, Si, etc.). When hydrogen bonds
    to more electronegative elements, the shared electron pair is pulled toward the
    other element, leaving H partially positive. Examples: CH₄, NH₃, H₂O, HCl all
    have H in +1 state. This contrasts with ionic hydrides (NaH, CaH₂) where hydrogen
    exists as H⁻ ion with oxidation state -1. In H₂ molecule, hydrogen has oxidation
    state 0. The electronegativity of H is 2.1, intermediate between metals (low)
    and nonmetals (high).'
