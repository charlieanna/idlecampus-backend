  Steam reforming of methane (CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3H₂, followed by CO + H₂O → CO₂ + H₂)
  is the most economical large-scale method. Electrolysis produces very pure H₂ but
  is expensive.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'The most economical industrial method for large-scale hydrogen production
    is:'
  options:
  - Electrolysis of water
  - Steam reforming of methane
  - Bosch process
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Steam reforming of methane
  explanation: 'Industrial preparation of hydrogen is primarily done by steam reforming
    of methane (natural gas), which is the most economical large-scale method: CH₄
    + H₂O ⇌ CO + 3H₂ (at 750-900°C with Ni catalyst), followed by water-gas shift:
    CO + H₂O ⇌ CO₂ + H₂ (for additional H₂). This produces high-purity H₂ at low cost.
    Other industrial methods include: (1) Electrolysis of water (expensive, used when
    high purity needed), (2) Partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, (3) Coke-oven gas.
    Laboratory methods include: Zn + dilute acid, electrolysis of water, or Ca + 2H₂O
    → Ca(OH)₂ + H₂. Steam reforming accounts for ~95% of commercial H₂ production
    worldwide.'

  question: Which laboratory method produces the purest hydrogen?
  options:
  - Reaction of zinc with dilute HCl
  - Electrolysis of water
  - Reaction of sodium with water
  - Steam reforming of methane
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Electrolysis of water
  explanation: 'Electrolysis of water produces the purest hydrogen (>99.9% purity).
    Process: 2H₂O → 2H₂ + O₂ using DC current with electrodes in dilute H₂SO₄ or
    NaOH electrolyte. At cathode (−): 2H₂O + 2e⁻ → H₂↑ + 2OH⁻. At anode (+): 4OH⁻
    → O₂↑ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻. H₂ collects at cathode, O₂ at anode in 2:1 volume ratio.
    Advantages: Very pure H₂, no impurities. Disadvantages: Expensive due to high
    electricity cost, only ~4% of commercial H₂ produced this way. Other lab methods:
    Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂↑ (contains HCl vapor, Zn impurities), 2Na + 2H₂O → 2NaOH
    + H₂↑ (dangerous, contains moisture). Industrial: Steam reforming is cheapest
    but less pure.'

  question: What catalyst is used in steam reforming of methane?
  options:
  - Platinum
  - Nickel
  - Iron
  - Copper
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Nickel
  explanation: 'Nickel (Ni) catalyst is used in steam reforming of methane. Process:
    Step 1 (steam reforming): CH₄ + H₂O ⇌ CO + 3H₂ at 750-900°C with Ni catalyst,
    ΔH = +206 kJ/mol (endothermic). Step 2 (water-gas shift): CO + H₂O ⇌ CO₂ + H₂
    at 400-500°C with Fe-Cr catalyst, ΔH = -41 kJ/mol (exothermic). Overall: CH₄
    + 2H₂O → CO₂ + 4H₂. The Ni catalyst lowers activation energy for C-H bond breaking.
    High temperature favors endothermic forward reaction (Le Chatelier). The CO₂ is
    removed by scrubbing with amine solutions, yielding ~95% pure H₂. This method
    produces ~95% of commercial H₂ globally, used for: ammonia synthesis, petroleum
    refining, methanol production, hydrogenation reactions.'
