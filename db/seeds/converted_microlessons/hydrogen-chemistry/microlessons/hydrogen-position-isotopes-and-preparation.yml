    question: "Why is concentrated H₂SO₄ NOT used for the laboratory preparation of hydrogen gas from zinc?"
    options:
      - "Concentrated H₂SO₄ is too expensive for laboratory use"
      - "Concentrated H₂SO₄ acts as an oxidizing agent and produces SO₂ instead of H₂"
      - "Concentrated H₂SO₄ does not react with zinc metal"
      - "The reaction is too slow with concentrated H₂SO₄"
    correct_answer: "Concentrated H₂SO₄ acts as an oxidizing agent and produces SO₂ instead of H₂"
    explanation: "Concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a strong oxidizing agent due to the high oxidation state of sulfur (+6). When zinc reacts with concentrated H₂SO₄, instead of producing hydrogen gas, the sulfuric acid oxidizes zinc and itself gets reduced to SO₂ (sulfur dioxide). The reaction is: Zn + 2H₂SO₄(conc.) → ZnSO₄ + SO₂↑ + 2H₂O. In this reaction, sulfur is reduced from +6 oxidation state in H₂SO₄ to +4 in SO₂, while zinc is oxidized. No hydrogen gas is liberated. In contrast, dilute H₂SO₄ behaves primarily as an acid rather than an oxidizing agent, allowing the simple displacement reaction: Zn + H₂SO₄(dil.) → ZnSO₄ + H₂↑. Similarly, concentrated HNO₃ should also be avoided as it produces nitrogen oxides (NO, NO₂) instead of H₂. For laboratory hydrogen preparation, always use dilute acids like dilute H₂SO₄ or dilute HCl with active metals like zinc."

    question: "Which isotope of hydrogen has the LONGEST half-life and what is its decay product?"
    options:
      - "Deuterium (²H) with half-life of 12.3 years, decays to ³He"
      - "Tritium (³H) with half-life of 12.3 years, decays to ³He"
      - "Protium (¹H) is stable and does not decay"
      - "Tritium (³H) with half-life of 5.27 years, decays to ⁴He"
    correct_answer: "Tritium (³H) with half-life of 12.3 years, decays to ³He"
    explanation: "Among the three isotopes of hydrogen, tritium (³H or T) is the only radioactive isotope. Protium (¹H) and deuterium (²H or D) are both stable isotopes and do not undergo radioactive decay. Tritium has a nucleus containing 1 proton and 2 neutrons, making it unstable. It undergoes beta-minus (β⁻) decay with a half-life of 12.3 years. During this decay, one of the neutrons in the tritium nucleus converts to a proton, emitting an electron (beta particle) and an antineutrino: ³H → ³He + β⁻ + ν̄. The decay product is helium-3 (³He), a stable isotope of helium. Tritium's radioactive properties make it useful as a radioactive tracer in chemical and biological research, in self-luminous paints for watch dials and emergency exit signs, and in thermonuclear fusion reactions. Despite being radioactive, tritium is a relatively weak beta emitter and its radiation cannot penetrate human skin, though it poses risks if ingested or inhaled."

    question: "What is the MOST economical industrial method for large-scale hydrogen production?"
    options:
      - "Electrolysis of water"
      - "Lane's process using steam and hot iron"
      - "Steam reforming of methane (natural gas)"
      - "Bosch process (coal gasification)"
    correct_answer: "Steam reforming of methane (natural gas)"
    explanation: "Steam reforming of methane (natural gas) is the most economical and widely used industrial method for large-scale hydrogen production, accounting for about 95% of global hydrogen production. The process involves two main steps: (1) Steam reforming: CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3H₂ at 850°C using a nickel catalyst. (2) Water-gas shift reaction: CO + H₂O → CO₂ + H₂ at 400°C. The overall reaction is: CH₄ + 2H₂O → CO₂ + 4H₂. This method is economically superior because natural gas (methane) is abundant and relatively inexpensive, the process has high conversion efficiency, and it produces four moles of hydrogen from one mole of methane. While electrolysis of water produces the purest hydrogen (99.9%+), it is extremely expensive due to high electricity costs and is only economically viable when cheap renewable electricity is available. The Bosch process and Lane's process are older, less efficient methods. The main disadvantage of steam reforming is CO₂ emission, which is driving research into 'green hydrogen' production via renewable-powered electrolysis."
