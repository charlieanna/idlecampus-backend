    question: "A solution of H₂O₂ has a concentration of 1.5 M. What is its volume strength?"
    options:
      - "5.6 volume"
      - "11.2 volume"
      - "16.8 volume"
      - "22.4 volume"
    correct_answer: "16.8 volume"
    explanation: "Volume strength of hydrogen peroxide is defined as the volume of oxygen gas (measured at STP: 273 K and 1 atm) liberated by the complete decomposition of one volume of H₂O₂ solution. The relationship between molarity (M) and volume strength is given by: Volume strength = Molarity × 11.2. This relationship comes from the stoichiometry of H₂O₂ decomposition: 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂. From this equation, 2 moles of H₂O₂ produce 1 mole of O₂ (22.4 L at STP). Therefore, 1 mole of H₂O₂ produces 11.2 L of O₂ at STP. Hence, a 1 M solution (1 mole/L) of H₂O₂ will produce 11.2 L of O₂ per liter of solution, making it '11.2 volume' H₂O₂. For a 1.5 M solution: Volume strength = 1.5 × 11.2 = 16.8 volume. This means 1 L of this H₂O₂ solution will liberate 16.8 L of oxygen gas at STP upon complete decomposition. Volume strength is a convenient way to express H₂O₂ concentration in practical applications like bleaching and disinfection. Common commercial H₂O₂ is '10 volume' (approximately 3% w/v) used as an antiseptic."

    question: "When H₂O₂ is added to an acidified solution of potassium permanganate (KMnO₄), the purple color disappears. In this reaction, H₂O₂ acts as a:"
    options:
      - "Oxidizing agent, oxidizing Mn²⁺ to MnO₄⁻"
      - "Reducing agent, reducing MnO₄⁻ to Mn²⁺"
      - "Acidic reagent, neutralizing the base"
      - "Catalyst, speeding up the decomposition"
    correct_answer: "Reducing agent, reducing MnO₄⁻ to Mn²⁺"
    explanation: "Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) exhibits dual redox behavior - it can act as both an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent depending on the reaction partner. When H₂O₂ reacts with strong oxidizing agents like KMnO₄ or K₂Cr₂O₇, it acts as a reducing agent. In the reaction with acidified KMnO₄, the balanced equation is: 2KMnO₄ + 3H₂SO₄ + 5H₂O₂ → K₂SO₄ + 2MnSO₄ + 8H₂O + 5O₂↑. In this reaction, manganese is reduced from +7 oxidation state in MnO₄⁻ (purple) to +2 in Mn²⁺ (pale pink/colorless in dilute solution), while oxygen in H₂O₂ is oxidized from -1 to 0 in O₂. The half-reactions are: Reduction: MnO₄⁻ + 8H⁺ + 5e⁻ → Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O. Oxidation: H₂O₂ → O₂ + 2H⁺ + 2e⁻. The disappearance of purple color is a visual confirmation that MnO₄⁻ has been reduced to colorless Mn²⁺. This reaction is used as a quantitative test for H₂O₂. Conversely, with weaker reducing agents like Fe²⁺ or I⁻, H₂O₂ acts as an oxidizing agent."

    question: "What is the PRIMARY advantage of hydrogen fuel cells over conventional internal combustion engines?"
    options:
      - "Hydrogen fuel cells are cheaper to manufacture"
      - "Hydrogen fuel cells have much higher energy conversion efficiency (60-80%) and produce only water as a byproduct"
      - "Hydrogen fuel cells can operate at any temperature without special requirements"
      - "Hydrogen fuel cells use readily available hydrogen from the atmosphere"
    correct_answer: "Hydrogen fuel cells have much higher energy conversion efficiency (60-80%) and produce only water as a byproduct"
    explanation: "Hydrogen fuel cells offer several significant advantages over conventional internal combustion engines, with the most important being their superior energy conversion efficiency and environmental cleanliness. Fuel cells convert chemical energy directly to electrical energy through electrochemical reactions without combustion, achieving efficiencies of 60-80%. In contrast, internal combustion engines are limited by the Carnot cycle and typically achieve only 25-30% efficiency, with most energy lost as waste heat. The electrochemical reactions in a fuel cell are: Anode: 2H₂ → 4H⁺ + 4e⁻. Cathode: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O. Overall: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O + electrical energy + heat. The only byproduct is pure water, making fuel cells completely clean with zero greenhouse gas emissions, air pollutants, or particulates. Additional advantages include silent operation (no moving parts in the cell itself), modular scalability, and potential for using renewable hydrogen. However, fuel cells currently face challenges including high manufacturing costs (due to platinum catalysts), hydrogen storage difficulties, lack of infrastructure, and most hydrogen today being produced from fossil fuels rather than renewable sources ('green hydrogen')."
