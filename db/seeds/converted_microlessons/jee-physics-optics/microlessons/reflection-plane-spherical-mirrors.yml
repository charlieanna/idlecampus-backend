  # Reflection: Plane and Spherical Mirrors

  ## Laws of Reflection

  1. **Incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in same plane**
  2. **Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection** (∠i = ∠r)

  These laws hold for all surfaces - plane or curved.

  ## Plane Mirror

  ### Properties of Image:
  - **Same size** as object (magnification = 1)
  - **Virtual and erect**
  - **Laterally inverted** (left-right reversal)
  - **Distance of image = Distance of object** (from mirror)

  ### Important Formulas:

  **Minimum mirror height to see full image:**
  ```
  h_mirror = H_person/2
  ```

  **Image velocity:**
  ```
  v_image = -v_object (relative to mirror)
  |v_image - v_mirror| = |v_object - v_mirror|
  ```

  **Rotation of mirror by angle θ:**
  ```
  Reflected ray rotates by 2θ
  ```

  **Number of images (two mirrors at angle θ):**
  ```
  n = 360°/θ - 1 (if 360°/θ is even)
  n = 360°/θ (if 360°/θ is odd and object on bisector)
  ```

  ## Spherical Mirrors

  ### Types:
  - **Concave (Converging)**: Reflecting surface is inside sphere
  - **Convex (Diverging)**: Reflecting surface is outside sphere

  ### Key Terms:
  - **Pole (P)**: Center of mirror surface
  - **Center of Curvature (C)**: Center of sphere
  - **Radius of Curvature (R)**: Radius of sphere
  - **Principal Axis**: Line through P and C
  - **Focus (F)**: Point where paraxial rays converge/diverge
  - **Focal Length (f)**: f = R/2

  ## Sign Convention (New Cartesian)

  1. **Object always on left** of mirror
  2. **Distances measured from pole**
  3. **Along principal axis**: +ve to right, -ve to left
  4. **Perpendicular to axis**: +ve upward, -ve downward
  5. **For mirrors**: Incident light from left

  ## Mirror Formula

  ```
  1/f = 1/v + 1/u

  or

  1/v + 1/u = 2/R
  ```

  Where:
  - u = object distance (always -ve for real object)
  - v = image distance
  - f = focal length

  ## Magnification

  ### Linear Magnification:
  ```
  m = h_i/h_o = -v/u
  ```

  - m > 0: Image erect (virtual)
  - m < 0: Image inverted (real)
  - |m| > 1: Image enlarged
  - |m| < 1: Image diminished

  ### Longitudinal Magnification:
  ```
  m_L = dv/du = -m² = -v²/u²
  ```

  ## Image Formation by Concave Mirror

  | Object Position | Image Position | Nature | Size |
  |----------------|----------------|--------|------|
  | At ∞ | At F | Real, inverted | Point |
  | Beyond C | Between F and C | Real, inverted | Diminished |
  | At C | At C | Real, inverted | Same |
  | Between F and C | Beyond C | Real, inverted | Enlarged |
  | At F | At ∞ | Real, inverted | Highly enlarged |
  | Between F and P | Behind mirror | Virtual, erect | Enlarged |

  ## Image Formation by Convex Mirror

  - **Always virtual, erect, diminished**
  - **Image between P and F** (behind mirror)
  - Used as rear-view mirrors (wider field of view)

  ## Power of Mirror

  ```
  P = 1/f (in meters) = -100/f (in cm)

  Unit: Diopter (D)
  ```

  - Concave: P is positive
  - Convex: P is negative

  ## Important JEE Problems

  ### 1. Object at Focus:
  Concave: Image at infinity
  Convex: Image at f/2 behind mirror (virtual)

  ### 2. Object Moving Along Principal Axis:
  ```
  v_i = -m² × v_o
  ```

  ### 3. Object Moving Perpendicular to Axis:
  ```
  v_i (perpendicular) = m × v_o
  ```

  ## Numerical Example

  **Problem:** Concave mirror, f = -10 cm, object at u = -30 cm. Find image position and magnification.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  1/v + 1/u = 1/f
  1/v + 1/(-30) = 1/(-10)
  1/v = -1/10 + 1/30 = (-3+1)/30 = -2/30 = -1/15
  v = -15 cm (real image, same side as object)

  m = -v/u = -(-15)/(-30) = -0.5
  Image is real, inverted, and diminished (half size)
  ```

  question: "A person stands 1 m in front of a plane mirror. If he walks 50 cm towards mirror, the distance between him and his image becomes:"
  options:
  - "50 cm"
  - "100 cm"
  - "150 cm"
  - "200 cm"
  correct_answer: "100 cm"
  explanation: "Initially: Person at 1m from mirror, image at 1m behind mirror, separation = 2m. After walking 50cm towards mirror: Person at 0.5m from mirror, image at 0.5m behind mirror, separation = 1m = 100 cm. The key insight: distance between object and image = 2 × (distance from mirror). When person moves 50cm closer, both person and image move 50cm closer to mirror, reducing separation by 2×50 = 100cm. This is why the answer is half of initial separation."

  question: "An object placed 20 cm in front of a concave mirror produces real image at 30 cm. The focal length of mirror is:"
  options:
  - "10 cm"
  - "12 cm"
  - "15 cm"
  - "25 cm"
  correct_answer: "12 cm"
  explanation: "Using sign convention: u = -20 cm (object on left), v = -30 cm (real image on same side). Apply mirror formula: 1/f = 1/v + 1/u = 1/(-30) + 1/(-20) = -1/30 - 1/20 = (-2-3)/60 = -5/60 = -1/12. Therefore f = -12 cm. The negative sign indicates concave mirror. Focal length magnitude is 12 cm. Note: Both u and v are negative because both object and image are on the reflecting side of concave mirror. This is a fundamental JEE numerical."

  question: "A convex mirror always forms:"
  options:
  - "Real, inverted, diminished image"
  - "Virtual, erect, enlarged image"
  - "Virtual, erect, diminished image"
  - "Real, inverted, enlarged image"
  correct_answer: "Virtual, erect, diminished image"
  explanation: "Convex mirror ALWAYS produces virtual, erect, and diminished images regardless of object position. This is because: (1) Reflected rays diverge and appear to come from behind mirror (virtual), (2) Image forms behind mirror maintaining orientation (erect), (3) Image is always between P and F, closer to F (diminished). This property makes convex mirrors ideal for rear-view mirrors in vehicles - they provide wider field of view though objects appear smaller ('Objects in mirror are closer than they appear'). In contrast, concave mirrors can form both real and virtual images depending on object position."
