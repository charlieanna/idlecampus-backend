  # Refraction and Snell's Law

  ## What is Refraction?

  **Refraction** is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another due to change in speed.

  ## Laws of Refraction

  ### First Law:
  Incident ray, refracted ray, and normal lie in the same plane.

  ### Second Law (Snell's Law):
  ```
  n₁ sin θ₁ = n₂ sin θ₂

  or

  sin i / sin r = n₂/n₁ = constant
  ```

  ## Refractive Index

  ### Absolute Refractive Index:
  ```
  n = c/v = Speed in vacuum / Speed in medium

  For air: n ≈ 1.0003 ≈ 1
  For water: n ≈ 1.33
  For glass: n ≈ 1.5
  For diamond: n ≈ 2.42
  ```

  ### Relative Refractive Index:
  ```
  ₁n₂ = n₂/n₁ = v₁/v₂ = λ₁/λ₂
  ```

  ## Key Relationships

  ```
  n = c/v = λ₀/λ_medium

  Frequency remains constant during refraction!
  v₁/v₂ = λ₁/λ₂ = n₂/n₁
  ```

  ## Bending Towards/Away from Normal

  ### Denser to Rarer (n₁ > n₂):
  - Light bends **away** from normal
  - r > i
  - Speed increases

  ### Rarer to Denser (n₁ < n₂):
  - Light bends **towards** normal
  - r < i
  - Speed decreases

  ## Important Applications

  ### 1. Apparent Depth
  ```
  Apparent depth = Real depth / n

  Shift = Real depth × (1 - 1/n)
  ```

  Object appears closer when viewed through denser medium.

  ### 2. Lateral Shift Through Glass Slab
  ```
  d = t sin(i-r) / cos r

  where t = thickness of slab
  ```

  Emergent ray parallel to incident ray but displaced.

  ### 3. Real and Apparent Thickness of Multiple Layers
  ```
  Apparent thickness = Σ(tᵢ/nᵢ)
  ```

  ## Refraction Through Prism

  ### Prism Formula:
  ```
  A = r₁ + r₂ (angles of refraction at two surfaces)
  δ = (i₁ + i₂) - A (deviation)
  ```

  ### Minimum Deviation:
  When i₁ = i₂ and r₁ = r₂:
  ```
  δₘᵢₙ = 2i - A

  n = sin((A + δₘᵢₙ)/2) / sin(A/2)
  ```

  ### Thin Prism (A < 10°):
  ```
  δ = (n - 1)A
  ```

  ## Dispersion

  Different wavelengths have different refractive indices:
  ```
  n_violet > n_red
  λ_red > λ_violet

  White light splits into VIBGYOR
  ```

  ### Angular Dispersion:
  ```
  θ = (n_v - n_r)A
  ```

  ### Dispersive Power:
  ```
  ω = (n_v - n_r)/(n_y - 1) = Angular dispersion / Mean deviation
  ```

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Light travels from air to glass (n = 1.5). If angle of incidence is 30°, find angle of refraction.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  sin i / sin r = n
  sin 30° / sin r = 1.5
  0.5 / sin r = 1.5
  sin r = 0.5/1.5 = 1/3
  r = sin⁻¹(1/3) ≈ 19.47°
  ```

  **Example 2:** A coin at bottom of 4m deep pool. What is apparent depth? (n_water = 4/3)

  **Solution:**
  ```
  Apparent depth = Real depth / n
  = 4 / (4/3) = 4 × 3/4 = 3 m

  Coin appears 1 m closer to surface.
  ```

  **Example 3:** Prism with A = 60° and n = 1.5. Find minimum deviation.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  n = sin((A + δₘ)/2) / sin(A/2)
  1.5 = sin((60° + δₘ)/2) / sin(30°)
  1.5 = sin((60° + δₘ)/2) / 0.5
  sin((60° + δₘ)/2) = 0.75
  (60° + δₘ)/2 = 48.59°
  60° + δₘ = 97.18°
  δₘ ≈ 37.2°
  ```

  ## JEE Important Points

  1. **Frequency constant**, wavelength and velocity change
  2. **n ∝ 1/λ** (violet bends most)
  3. **Apparent depth < Real depth** (denser medium)
  4. **Glass slab causes lateral shift**, not angular deviation
  5. **At minimum deviation**, ray inside prism is parallel to base
  6. **Critical angle exists only** when going from denser to rarer

  question: "Light travels from medium A to medium B. If speed increases, which is true?"
  options:
  - "Light bends towards normal, A is rarer"
  - "Light bends away from normal, A is denser"
  - "Light bends towards normal, A is denser"
  - "No bending occurs"
  correct_answer: "Light bends away from normal, A is denser"
  explanation: "If speed increases (v₂ > v₁), then n₂ < n₁ (since n ∝ 1/v). Medium A is denser (higher n). When light goes from denser to rarer medium, it bends away from normal. Using Snell's law: n₁ sin θ₁ = n₂ sin θ₂. Since n₁ > n₂, sin θ₂ > sin θ₁, so θ₂ > θ₁. The refracted ray makes larger angle with normal (bends away). This is opposite to what happens going into denser medium (like air to water) where light bends towards normal."

  question: "A mark at bottom of a beaker filled with liquid appears to rise by 2 cm. If real depth is 8 cm, refractive index is:"
  options:
  - "1.25"
  - "1.33"
  - "1.5"
  - "4"
  correct_answer: "1.33"
  explanation: "Apparent depth = Real depth - Shift = 8 - 2 = 6 cm. Using formula: Apparent depth = Real depth / n. So 6 = 8/n, giving n = 8/6 = 4/3 ≈ 1.33. This is refractive index of water. The shift formula: Shift = Real depth(1 - 1/n) = 8(1 - 3/4) = 8 × 1/4 = 2 cm ✓. This explains why pools look shallower than they are, and fish appear closer to surface than actual position. Important safety consideration when diving!"

  question: "A thin prism of angle 4° and refractive index 1.5 produces deviation of:"
  options:
  - "2°"
  - "4°"
  - "6°"
  - "8°"
  correct_answer: "2°"
  explanation: "For thin prism (A < 10°): δ = (n - 1)A = (1.5 - 1) × 4° = 0.5 × 4° = 2°. This approximation works because for small angles, sin θ ≈ θ (in radians). The deviation is independent of angle of incidence for thin prisms (no minimum deviation condition needed). This formula is derived from full prism equation when angles are small. Note: Deviation is less than prism angle when n < 2, equals it when n = 2, exceeds it when n > 2. For n = 1.5, δ = A/2."
