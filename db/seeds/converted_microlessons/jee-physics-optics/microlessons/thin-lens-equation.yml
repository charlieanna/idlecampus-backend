  # Thin Lens Equation and Power

  ## Types of Lenses

  ### Convex (Converging):
  - Thicker in middle
  - Converges light rays
  - Positive focal length

  ### Concave (Diverging):
  - Thinner in middle
  - Diverges light rays
  - Negative focal length

  ## Sign Convention (New Cartesian)

  - Light travels left to right
  - Origin at optical center (O)
  - Distances along light: +ve
  - Distances against light: -ve
  - Heights above axis: +ve
  - Heights below axis: -ve

  ## Thin Lens Equation

  ```
  1/v - 1/u = 1/f

  OR

  1/f = 1/v - 1/u
  ```

  ### Variables:
  - u = object distance (always -ve for real object)
  - v = image distance (+ve real, -ve virtual)
  - f = focal length (+ve convex, -ve concave)

  ## Linear Magnification

  ```
  m = h'/h = v/u

  m > 0: Erect image
  m < 0: Inverted image
  |m| > 1: Magnified
  |m| < 1: Diminished
  ```

  ## Image Formation by Convex Lens

  | Object Position | Image Position | Nature |
  |----------------|----------------|--------|
  | At ∞ | At F | Real, inverted, point |
  | Beyond 2F | Between F and 2F | Real, inverted, diminished |
  | At 2F | At 2F | Real, inverted, same size |
  | Between F and 2F | Beyond 2F | Real, inverted, magnified |
  | At F | At ∞ | - |
  | Between F and O | Same side | Virtual, erect, magnified |

  ## Image Formation by Concave Lens

  Always forms:
  - Virtual image
  - Erect
  - Diminished
  - On same side as object
  - Between O and F

  ## Power of Lens

  ```
  P = 1/f (f in meters)

  Unit: Diopter (D) = m⁻¹
  ```

  ### Properties:
  - Convex: P > 0 (converging)
  - Concave: P < 0 (diverging)
  - Higher |P| = stronger lens

  ## Lens Maker's Formula

  ```
  1/f = (n - 1)(1/R₁ - 1/R₂)

  n = refractive index of lens material
  R₁ = radius of first surface
  R₂ = radius of second surface
  ```

  Sign convention for R:
  - Center of curvature on right of surface: R > 0
  - Center of curvature on left of surface: R < 0

  ## Combination of Thin Lenses

  ### In Contact:
  ```
  P_total = P₁ + P₂ + P₃ + ...
  1/f_eq = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ + 1/f₃ + ...
  ```

  ### Separated by Distance d:
  ```
  P = P₁ + P₂ - dP₁P₂
  1/f = 1/f₁ + 1/f₂ - d/(f₁f₂)
  ```

  ## Displacement Method

  For two positions of lens (distance d apart) giving images:
  ```
  f = (D² - d²)/(4D)

  D = object-to-screen distance
  d = distance between two lens positions
  ```

  Also:
  ```
  Object size × Image size = (Actual size)²
  h₁ × h₂ = h²
  ```

  ## Aberrations

  ### 1. Spherical Aberration:
  - Marginal rays focus closer than paraxial rays
  - Remedy: Use stops or aspherical lenses

  ### 2. Chromatic Aberration:
  - Different colors focus at different points
  - f_violet < f_red (higher n for violet)
  - Remedy: Achromatic doublet

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Object 30 cm from convex lens (f = 20 cm). Find image.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  u = -30 cm, f = +20 cm
  1/v - 1/u = 1/f
  1/v = 1/20 + 1/(-30) = 1/20 - 1/30
  1/v = 3/60 - 2/60 = 1/60
  v = 60 cm (real image)

  m = v/u = 60/(-30) = -2
  Magnified, inverted, real.
  ```

  **Example 2:** Concave lens (f = -15 cm). Object at 30 cm. Find image.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  u = -30 cm, f = -15 cm
  1/v = 1/f + 1/u = -1/15 - 1/30
  1/v = -2/30 - 1/30 = -3/30 = -1/10
  v = -10 cm

  Image virtual, erect, diminished (v < u).
  m = -10/-30 = 1/3 (one-third size)
  ```

  **Example 3:** Two lenses +10 D and -4 D in contact. Find equivalent power and focal length.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  P = P₁ + P₂ = 10 + (-4) = +6 D
  f = 1/P = 1/6 m ≈ 16.7 cm

  Combination is converging.
  ```

  ## JEE Key Points

  1. **1/v - 1/u = 1/f** (lens equation)
  2. **m = v/u** (magnification)
  3. **P = 1/f** (power in diopters)
  4. **P_total = P₁ + P₂** (lenses in contact)
  5. **Convex: f > 0, Concave: f < 0**
  6. **Sign convention crucial!**

  question: "A convex lens of focal length 20 cm forms image of same size as object. Object distance is:"
  options:
  - "20 cm"
  - "40 cm"
  - "10 cm"
  - "60 cm"
  correct_answer: "40 cm"
  explanation: "Same size image means |m| = 1. For lens: m = v/u = -1 (inverted same size, real). So v = -u. Using lens equation: 1/v - 1/u = 1/f. 1/(-u) - 1/u = 1/20. -2/u = 1/20. u = -40 cm. Object is at 40 cm (at 2f). This is special case: when object is at 2f, image is at 2f on other side, same size but inverted. For convex lens, this is only distance giving m = -1. If m = +1 (erect same size), object would need to be at lens itself (trivial case). The 2f point is useful reference in ray diagrams and experiments."

  question: "Power of combination of convex lens (+3 D) and concave lens (-5 D) in contact is:"
  options:
  - "+8 D"
  - "-8 D"
  - "+2 D"
  - "-2 D"
  correct_answer: "-2 D"
  explanation: "For lenses in contact: P_total = P₁ + P₂ = 3 + (-5) = -2 D. Combination is diverging! The concave lens is stronger (|−5| > |+3|), so net effect is diverging. Focal length: f = 1/P = -0.5 m = -50 cm. This principle is used in corrective eyewear: myopia needs diverging correction (concave or negative power), hypermetropia needs converging (convex or positive power). An achromatic doublet uses combination of convex (crown glass) and concave (flint glass) to cancel chromatic aberration while maintaining focusing power. Sign and magnitude both matter!"

  question: "A lens has focal length 25 cm in air (n=1). When immersed in water (n=4/3), focal length:"
  options:
  - "Increases"
  - "Decreases"
  - "Remains same"
  - "Becomes infinite"
  correct_answer: "Increases"
  explanation: "Using lens maker's formula: 1/f = (n_rel - 1)(1/R₁ - 1/R₂). In air: n_rel = n_glass/1 ≈ 1.5. In water: n_rel = n_glass/n_water = 1.5/1.33 ≈ 1.13. Since n_rel decreases in water, (n_rel - 1) decreases, so 1/f decreases, meaning f increases! Lens becomes weaker in water. If n_lens = n_medium: f → ∞ (lens disappears optically). This is why submerged objects appear at unexpected positions. For glass lens in water, f roughly quadruples. Fish see differently because their eye lens is designed for water as medium. Human eye can't focus well underwater without goggles (air medium)."
