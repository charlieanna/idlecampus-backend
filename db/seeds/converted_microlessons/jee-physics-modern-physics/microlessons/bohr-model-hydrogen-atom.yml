  # Bohr Model of Hydrogen Atom

  ## Bohr's Postulates (1913)

  ### 1. Quantized Orbits
  Electrons revolve in certain stable orbits without radiating energy.

  ### 2. Angular Momentum Quantization
  ```
  mvr = nh/2π = nℏ

  where n = 1, 2, 3, ... (principal quantum number)
  ℏ = h/(2π) = 1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s
  ```

  ### 3. Energy Transitions
  Electrons can jump between orbits by absorbing/emitting photons:
  ```
  hf = E₂ - E₁
  ```

  ## Derivation of Bohr Radii

  ### Centripetal Force = Electrostatic Force:
  ```
  mv²/r = ke²/r²
  mv² = ke²/r ... (1)
  ```

  ### Angular Momentum Quantization:
  ```
  mvr = nℏ
  v = nℏ/(mr) ... (2)
  ```

  ### Substituting (2) in (1):
  ```
  m(nℏ/(mr))² = ke²/r
  n²ℏ²/(mr) = ke²
  r = n²ℏ²/(mke²)
  ```

  ### Bohr Radius (n = 1):
  ```
  a₀ = ℏ²/(mke²) = 0.529 Å = 5.29×10⁻¹¹ m

  For nth orbit: rₙ = n²a₀ = n²(0.529 Å)
  ```

  ## Velocity of Electron

  ```
  vₙ = ke²/(nℏ) = v₁/n

  v₁ = ke²/ℏ = 2.18×10⁶ m/s = c/137

  Fine structure constant: α = v₁/c ≈ 1/137
  ```

  ## Energy of Electron

  ### Kinetic Energy:
  ```
  KE = ½mv² = ke²/(2r) = E₀/n²
  ```

  ### Potential Energy:
  ```
  PE = -ke²/r = -2KE
  ```

  ### Total Energy:
  ```
  Eₙ = KE + PE = -ke²/(2r) = -13.6/n² eV

  E₁ = -13.6 eV (ground state)
  E₂ = -3.4 eV
  E₃ = -1.51 eV
  E∞ = 0 (ionization)
  ```

  ## Important Formulas

  ### Radius:
  ```
  rₙ = n²a₀ = n²(0.529 Å)
  rₙ ∝ n²
  ```

  ### Velocity:
  ```
  vₙ = v₁/n
  vₙ ∝ 1/n
  ```

  ### Energy:
  ```
  Eₙ = -13.6/n² eV
  Eₙ ∝ -1/n²
  ```

  ### Time Period:
  ```
  Tₙ = 2πrₙ/vₙ ∝ n³
  ```

  ### Frequency of Revolution:
  ```
  fₙ = 1/Tₙ ∝ 1/n³
  ```

  ### Current:
  ```
  iₙ = ef_n ∝ 1/n³
  ```

  ## Hydrogen Spectrum

  ### Emission Spectrum:
  When electron falls from higher to lower orbit:
  ```
  1/λ = RH(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²)

  RH = 1.097×10⁷ m⁻¹ (Rydberg constant)
  ```

  ### Spectral Series:

  | Series | n₁ | n₂ | Region |
  |--------|----|----|--------|
  | Lyman | 1 | 2,3,4,... | UV |
  | Balmer | 2 | 3,4,5,... | Visible |
  | Paschen | 3 | 4,5,6,... | IR |
  | Brackett | 4 | 5,6,7,... | IR |
  | Pfund | 5 | 6,7,8,... | Far IR |

  ### Balmer Series (Visible):
  - n₂ = 3: Hα (656 nm, red)
  - n₂ = 4: Hβ (486 nm, blue-green)
  - n₂ = 5: Hγ (434 nm, violet)
  - Series limit: n₂ → ∞ (365 nm)

  ### Lyman Series (UV):
  ```
  First line: 1/λ = RH(1 - 1/4) = 3RH/4
  λ = 121.5 nm

  Series limit: λ = 91.2 nm
  ```

  ## Ionization Energy

  Energy needed to remove electron from ground state:
  ```
  IE = 13.6 eV = 2.18×10⁻¹⁸ J
  ```

  ## Excitation Energy

  Energy needed to move electron to higher level:
  ```
  First excitation (n=1 to n=2):
  ΔE = -3.4 - (-13.6) = 10.2 eV
  ```

  ## Number of Spectral Lines

  When electron falls from n to ground state:
  ```
  Total lines = n(n-1)/2
  ```

  Example: From n=4: Lines = 4(3)/2 = 6

  ## For Hydrogen-like Ions

  For ions with atomic number Z:
  ```
  rₙ = n²a₀/Z
  Eₙ = -13.6Z²/n² eV
  vₙ = Zv₁/n
  ```

  Examples:
  - He⁺ (Z=2): E₁ = -54.4 eV
  - Li²⁺ (Z=3): E₁ = -122.4 eV

  ## Limitations of Bohr Model

  1. Works only for single-electron systems
  2. Cannot explain fine structure
  3. Cannot predict line intensities
  4. No explanation for Zeeman effect
  5. Violates uncertainty principle

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Find wavelength of Hα line (Balmer series first line).

  **Solution:**
  ```
  1/λ = RH(1/4 - 1/9) = RH(9-4)/36 = 5RH/36
  λ = 36/(5RH) = 36/(5×1.097×10⁷)
  λ = 656.3 nm (red line)
  ```

  **Example 2:** Ionization potential of Li²⁺ is:

  **Solution:**
  ```
  E₁ = -13.6Z²/1² = -13.6(9) = -122.4 eV
  IP = 122.4 V
  ```

  **Example 3:** Ratio of radii of second to first orbit is:

  **Solution:**
  ```
  r₂/r₁ = (2²a₀)/(1²a₀) = 4/1 = 4
  ```

  question: "The ratio of velocities of electron in first and third Bohr orbits is:"
  options:
  - "1:3"
  - "3:1"
  - "1:9"
  - "9:1"
  correct_answer: "3:1"
  explanation: "Velocity vₙ = v₁/n, so vₙ ∝ 1/n. For first orbit: v₁ ∝ 1. For third orbit: v₃ ∝ 1/3. Ratio v₁:v₃ = 1:(1/3) = 3:1. The electron moves slower in outer orbits because it's farther from nucleus (less electrostatic pull). Compare with classical orbits: Planets farther from Sun also move slower (Kepler's laws). The velocity ratio helps calculate kinetic energy ratio, time period ratio, etc. KE ratio = v²: (v/3)² = 9:1."

  question: "Ionization energy of hydrogen atom is 13.6 eV. The energy required to excite electron from ground state to first excited state is:"
  options:
  - "13.6 eV"
  - "10.2 eV"
  - "3.4 eV"
  - "12.1 eV"
  correct_answer: "10.2 eV"
  explanation: "Ground state energy E₁ = -13.6 eV. First excited state (n=2): E₂ = -13.6/4 = -3.4 eV. Excitation energy = E₂ - E₁ = -3.4 - (-13.6) = 10.2 eV. This means 10.2 eV photon (or electron with KE ≥ 10.2 eV) can excite hydrogen from ground to first excited state. The remaining 3.4 eV (difference from ionization 13.6 eV) keeps electron bound. When atom de-excites, it emits 10.2 eV photon (Lyman α line at 121.5 nm, UV)."

  question: "When electron in hydrogen atom jumps from n=4 to n=2, the wavelength of emitted radiation belongs to:"
  options:
  - "Lyman series"
  - "Balmer series"
  - "Paschen series"
  - "Brackett series"
  correct_answer: "Balmer series"
  explanation: "Series are defined by the final state: Lyman (n→1), Balmer (n→2), Paschen (n→3), etc. Transition from n=4 to n=2 is Balmer series (second line, Hβ). Energy: ΔE = 13.6(1/4 - 1/16) = 13.6(3/16) = 2.55 eV. Wavelength: λ = hc/E = 1240/2.55 ≈ 486 nm (blue-green, visible). Balmer series is special as it falls in visible range (400-700 nm), making it historically important for discovering atomic structure. Lyman is UV, Paschen and beyond are IR."
