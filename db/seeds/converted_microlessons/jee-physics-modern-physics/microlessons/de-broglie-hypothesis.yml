  # de Broglie Hypothesis and Matter Waves

  ## Wave-Particle Duality

  Einstein showed light has dual nature:
  - **Wave:** Interference, diffraction
  - **Particle:** Photoelectric effect, Compton effect

  ## de Broglie Hypothesis (1924)

  **If light can behave as particles, matter should behave as waves.**

  ### de Broglie Wavelength:
  ```
  λ = h/p = h/(mv)

  h = Planck's constant = 6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s
  p = momentum
  m = mass
  v = velocity
  ```

  ### For photon (E = pc):
  ```
  λ = h/p = hc/E
  ```

  ### For particle with kinetic energy K:
  ```
  λ = h/√(2mK)

  Since K = p²/(2m)
  ```

  ## Important Formulas

  ### For Electron:
  ```
  λ = h/√(2meV) = h/√(2m_e eV)

  V = accelerating potential
  e = electron charge
  m_e = electron mass
  ```

  ### Simplified (for electron):
  ```
  λ = 12.27/√V Å (V in volts)

  OR

  λ = 1.227/√V nm
  ```

  ### At temperature T:
  ```
  Average KE = (3/2)kT
  λ = h/√(3mkT)
  ```

  ## Relativistic de Broglie Wavelength

  For high-speed particles:
  ```
  λ = h/p = h/(γmv)

  γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²) (Lorentz factor)
  ```

  ## Properties of Matter Waves

  1. **Wavelength inversely proportional to momentum**
  2. **Heavier particles have shorter wavelengths**
  3. **Not electromagnetic waves**
  4. **Probability waves** (quantum mechanical interpretation)

  ## Comparison

  | Property | Photon | Electron |
  |----------|--------|----------|
  | Rest mass | 0 | m_e = 9.1×10⁻³¹ kg |
  | Momentum | p = E/c = hf/c | p = mv |
  | Wavelength | λ = hc/E | λ = h/(mv) |
  | Speed | c (always) | v < c (variable) |

  ## Experimental Verification

  ### Davisson-Germer Experiment (1927):
  - Electrons diffracted by nickel crystal
  - Confirmed wave nature of electrons
  - Verified de Broglie wavelength

  ```
  Bragg's law: 2d sin θ = nλ
  Matched with λ = h/(mv) from de Broglie
  ```

  ### G.P. Thomson's Experiment:
  - Electron diffraction through thin foil
  - Produced diffraction rings
  - Nobel Prize 1937

  ## Applications

  ### 1. Electron Microscope:
  - Electrons have much shorter λ than visible light
  - Can resolve smaller objects
  - λ_electron << λ_light
  - Resolution: ~0.1 nm (vs ~500 nm for light)

  ### 2. Electron Diffraction:
  - Study crystal structures
  - Material analysis

  ### 3. Scanning Tunneling Microscope:
  - Uses quantum tunneling
  - Atomic resolution

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Find de Broglie wavelength of electron accelerated through 100 V.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  λ = 12.27/√V = 12.27/√100 = 12.27/10 = 1.227 Å

  Very small! Comparable to atomic dimensions.
  ```

  **Example 2:** Cricket ball (150 g) moving at 30 m/s. Find wavelength.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  λ = h/(mv) = (6.626×10⁻³⁴)/(0.15 × 30)
  λ = 6.626×10⁻³⁴/4.5 ≈ 1.5×10⁻³⁴ m

  Incredibly small! Unobservable in daily life.
  ```

  **Example 3:** Proton and electron have same de Broglie wavelength. Find ratio of their velocities.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  λ_p = h/(m_p v_p) = λ_e = h/(m_e v_e)
  m_p v_p = m_e v_e
  v_e/v_p = m_p/m_e ≈ 1836

  Electron moves 1836 times faster!
  ```

  ## Why Don't We See Matter Waves?

  For macroscopic objects:
  - Mass is large → λ extremely small
  - λ << size of object
  - Wave effects negligible

  For quantum particles (electrons, atoms):
  - Mass is tiny → λ comparable to size
  - Wave effects significant
  - Quantum mechanics essential

  ## Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

  ```
  Δx × Δp ≥ ℏ/2

  ΔE × Δt ≥ ℏ/2
  ```

  Cannot simultaneously know exact position and momentum.

  question: "De Broglie wavelength of electron accelerated through potential V is λ. If potential is made 4V, new wavelength is:"
  options:
  - "4λ"
  - "2λ"
  - "λ/2"
  - "λ/4"
  correct_answer: "λ/2"
  explanation: "λ = h/√(2meV) ∝ 1/√V. If V → 4V: λ' = λ/√4 = λ/2. Wavelength halves! This is inverse square root relationship. To reduce wavelength by factor 2, increase voltage by factor 4. This principle is used in electron microscopes - higher accelerating voltage gives shorter wavelength and better resolution. For 100 V: λ ≈ 1.2 Å. For 400 V: λ ≈ 0.6 Å. For 10,000 V: λ ≈ 0.12 Å (smaller than atom size!). Higher energy electrons can probe smaller structures."

  question: "An α-particle and proton have same kinetic energy. Ratio of their de Broglie wavelengths λ_α/λ_p is:"
  options:
  - "1:1"
  - "1:2"
  - "2:1"
  - "1:4"
  correct_answer: "1:2"
  explanation: "λ = h/√(2mK). For same K: λ ∝ 1/√m. α-particle: mass = 4m_p. λ_α/λ_p = √(m_p/m_α) = √(m_p/4m_p) = 1/2. So λ_α : λ_p = 1:2. Heavier particle has shorter wavelength at same energy! This is because heavier particle has more momentum for same KE: p = √(2mK) ∝ √m. Since λ = h/p, larger p means smaller λ. In contrast, if same MOMENTUM: λ would be same (λ = h/p). Always clarify whether comparing same energy or same momentum. This distinction is crucial in particle physics experiments."

  question: "De Broglie wavelength of neutron at temperature T is λ. At temperature 4T, wavelength becomes:"
  options:
  - "λ/4"
  - "λ/2"
  - "2λ"
  - "4λ"
  correct_answer: "λ/2"
  explanation: "At temperature T: Average KE = (3/2)kT. λ = h/√(2mK) = h/√(3mkT) ∝ 1/√T. If T → 4T: λ' = λ/√4 = λ/2. Wavelength halves when temperature quadruples. This is thermal de Broglie wavelength. At higher temperature, particles move faster (higher p), shorter λ. At room temperature (300 K), neutron λ ≈ 1.5 Å. At 1200 K: λ ≈ 0.75 Å. This is used in neutron diffraction studies where 'thermal neutrons' (neutrons at thermal equilibrium) have wavelengths similar to atomic spacings, making them ideal for crystal structure analysis."
