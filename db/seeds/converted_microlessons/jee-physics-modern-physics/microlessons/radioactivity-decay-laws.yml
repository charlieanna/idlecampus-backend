  # Radioactivity and Decay Laws

  ## What is Radioactivity?

  **Spontaneous emission** of radiation (α, β, γ) by unstable nuclei to achieve stability.

  ## Types of Radioactive Decay

  ### 1. Alpha Decay (α)
  ```
  ᴬzX → ᴬ⁻⁴z₋₂Y + ⁴₂He

  Example: ²³⁸U → ²³⁴Th + ⁴He
  ```
  - Emits helium nucleus (2p + 2n)
  - Mass number decreases by 4
  - Atomic number decreases by 2
  - Least penetrating (stopped by paper)
  - Most ionizing

  ### 2. Beta Decay (β⁻)
  ```
  ᴬzX → ᴬz₊₁Y + e⁻ + ν̄ₑ

  n → p + e⁻ + ν̄ₑ (at nuclear level)

  Example: ¹⁴C → ¹⁴N + e⁻ + ν̄ₑ
  ```
  - Emits electron and antineutrino
  - Mass number unchanged
  - Atomic number increases by 1
  - Moderate penetration (stopped by aluminum)

  ### 3. Beta Plus Decay (β⁺)
  ```
  ᴬzX → ᴬz₋₁Y + e⁺ + νₑ

  p → n + e⁺ + νₑ
  ```
  - Emits positron and neutrino
  - Atomic number decreases by 1

  ### 4. Gamma Decay (γ)
  ```
  ᴬzX* → ᴬzX + γ
  ```
  - Emits high-energy photon
  - No change in A or Z
  - Most penetrating (needs lead/concrete)
  - Least ionizing

  ## Radioactive Decay Law

  ### Differential Equation:
  ```
  dN/dt = -λN

  where λ = decay constant (s⁻¹)
  ```

  ### Solution:
  ```
  N(t) = N₀e⁻λt

  N₀ = initial number of nuclei
  N(t) = number at time t
  ```

  ### Activity (Decay Rate):
  ```
  A = dN/dt = λN = A₀e⁻λt

  Unit: Becquerel (Bq) = 1 decay/s
  1 Curie (Ci) = 3.7×10¹⁰ Bq
  ```

  ## Half-Life (T₁/₂)

  **Time for half the nuclei to decay.**

  ```
  T₁/₂ = ln(2)/λ = 0.693/λ

  λ = 0.693/T₁/₂
  ```

  ### Useful Relations:
  ```
  After n half-lives:
  N = N₀/2ⁿ
  A = A₀/2ⁿ

  After time t:
  N = N₀(1/2)^(t/T₁/₂)
  ```

  ## Mean Life (τ)

  **Average lifetime of a radioactive nucleus.**

  ```
  τ = 1/λ = T₁/₂/0.693 = 1.44T₁/₂
  ```

  Time for activity to fall to 1/e of initial.

  ## Important Formulas

  ### Number of Atoms Decayed:
  ```
  N_decayed = N₀ - N = N₀(1 - e⁻λt)

  After one half-life: N₀/2 atoms decay
  ```

  ### Fraction Remaining:
  ```
  N/N₀ = e⁻λt = (1/2)^(t/T₁/₂)
  ```

  ### Probability of Decay:
  ```
  P = 1 - e⁻λt ≈ λt (for small λt)
  ```

  ## Successive Radioactive Decay

  ```
  A → B → C (stable)
  λ₁   λ₂
  ```

  - A decays with constant λ₁
  - B formed from A, decays with λ₂
  - Secular equilibrium when λ₁ << λ₂:
    Activity of B ≈ Activity of A

  ## Carbon Dating

  ```
  ¹⁴C (T₁/₂ = 5730 years)

  Age = T₁/₂/0.693 × ln(A₀/A)
  ```

  Useful for dating up to ~50,000 years.

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Half-life is 10 days. Find fraction remaining after 30 days.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  n = t/T₁/₂ = 30/10 = 3 half-lives
  N/N₀ = (1/2)³ = 1/8

  12.5% remains, 87.5% decayed
  ```

  **Example 2:** Decay constant λ = 0.01 s⁻¹. Find half-life and mean life.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  T₁/₂ = 0.693/λ = 0.693/0.01 = 69.3 s
  τ = 1/λ = 1/0.01 = 100 s

  Check: τ = 1.44 × 69.3 ≈ 100 s ✓
  ```

  **Example 3:** Initial activity 1000 Bq. After 20 min, activity is 250 Bq. Find half-life.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  A/A₀ = 250/1000 = 1/4 = (1/2)²

  Two half-lives in 20 min
  T₁/₂ = 20/2 = 10 min
  ```

  ## Radioactive Series

  - **Uranium series**: ²³⁸U → ²⁰⁶Pb (4n+2 series)
  - **Actinium series**: ²³⁵U → ²⁰⁷Pb (4n+3 series)
  - **Thorium series**: ²³²Th → ²⁰⁸Pb (4n series)

  ## JEE Important Points

  1. **Decay is probabilistic**, not deterministic
  2. **λ is constant** for given isotope
  3. **Half-life ≠ mean life** (τ = 1.44T₁/₂)
  4. **Activity ∝ N** (more atoms = more decays)
  5. **After infinite time**, all atoms decay (N → 0)
  6. **In α decay**: A decreases by 4, Z by 2
  7. **In β⁻ decay**: A constant, Z increases by 1

  question: "A radioactive sample has half-life of 20 minutes. The time required for activity to decrease to 1/16 of initial is:"
  options:
  - "40 min"
  - "60 min"
  - "80 min"
  - "100 min"
  correct_answer: "80 min"
  explanation: "1/16 = (1/2)⁴, so 4 half-lives needed. Time = 4 × 20 = 80 minutes. After each half-life: 1 → 1/2 → 1/4 → 1/8 → 1/16. This shows exponential decay - even after 4 half-lives, 1/16 remains. To reach 1/1000 would need about 10 half-lives (1/1024 ≈ 1/1000). The beauty of half-life is its simplicity - just count how many times you need to halve to reach the fraction."

  question: "If half-life of a radioactive element is 30 days, the decay constant is:"
  options:
  - "0.0231 day⁻¹"
  - "0.693 day⁻¹"
  - "30 day⁻¹"
  - "0.0333 day⁻¹"
  correct_answer: "0.0231 day⁻¹"
  explanation: "λ = 0.693/T₁/₂ = 0.693/30 = 0.0231 day⁻¹. This means probability of decay per day is about 2.3%. Mean life τ = 1/λ = 1/0.0231 ≈ 43.3 days = 1.44 × 30 days. Note: λ has same dimension as 1/time. If you convert to seconds: λ = 0.0231/(24×3600) = 2.67×10⁻⁷ s⁻¹. Always check units match in calculations. Higher λ means faster decay (shorter half-life)."

  question: "In the decay ²³⁸U → ²⁰⁶Pb, the number of α and β⁻ particles emitted are:"
  options:
  - "8α and 6β"
  - "6α and 8β"
  - "4α and 2β"
  - "10α and 4β"
  correct_answer: "8α and 6β"
  explanation: "Mass number change: 238 - 206 = 32. Since each α reduces A by 4: Number of α = 32/4 = 8. Atomic number: Initial Z = 92 (U), Final Z = 82 (Pb). Each α reduces Z by 2: 8α reduces Z by 16. Expected Z after α: 92 - 16 = 76. But actual Z = 82. Difference = 82 - 76 = 6. Each β⁻ increases Z by 1, so 6β⁻ particles. Check: 92 - 16 + 6 = 82 ✓. This is the uranium decay series, involving multiple intermediate elements, ending at stable lead-206."
