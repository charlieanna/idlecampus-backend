  question: 'Calculate the energy of a photon emitted when an electron in a hydrogen atom transitions from n=3 to n=2.'
  options:
  - 1.89 eV
  - 3.4 eV
  - 10.2 eV
  - 13.6 eV
  correct_answer: 1.89 eV
  explanation: "According to Bohr's theory, when an electron transitions between energy levels in a hydrogen atom, the energy of the emitted photon is given by the formula: ΔE = 13.6Z²(1/n₁² - 1/n₂²) eV, where Z is the atomic number (Z=1 for hydrogen), n₁ is the lower energy level, and n₂ is the higher energy level. For the transition from n=3 to n=2: ΔE = 13.6 × 1² × (1/2² - 1/3²) = 13.6 × (1/4 - 1/9) = 13.6 × (9-4)/36 = 13.6 × 5/36 = 1.89 eV. This transition is part of the Balmer series, which involves transitions to n=2 and produces visible light. Converting to wavelength: E = hc/λ gives λ = 656 nm, which corresponds to the red line in the hydrogen spectrum. This characteristic red line (H-alpha line) is important in astronomy and spectroscopy. The Bohr model successfully explained the discrete line spectrum of hydrogen by proposing that electrons occupy quantized energy levels, and energy is emitted or absorbed only when electrons jump between these levels. The negative sign in the energy formula indicates that the electron is bound to the nucleus; zero energy corresponds to complete ionization (n = ∞)."

  question: 'What is the ionization energy of a hydrogen atom in its ground state?'
  options:
  - 13.6 eV
  - 3.4 eV
  - 1.51 eV
  - 27.2 eV
  correct_answer: 13.6 eV
  explanation: "The ionization energy is the minimum energy required to completely remove an electron from an atom in its ground state (n=1) to infinity (n=∞), where the electron becomes free and unbound. For a hydrogen atom, the energy of an electron in the nth orbit is given by Eₙ = -13.6Z²/n² eV. In the ground state (n=1), E₁ = -13.6 eV. At n = ∞ (ionized state), E∞ = 0 eV. The ionization energy is: ΔE = E∞ - E₁ = 0 - (-13.6) = 13.6 eV. This can also be expressed as 1312 kJ/mol or 2.18 × 10⁻¹⁸ J per atom. This value represents the binding energy of the electron in the ground state and is a fundamental constant for hydrogen. For hydrogen-like ions (He⁺, Li²⁺, etc.), the ionization energy is multiplied by Z² because the formula becomes -13.6Z²/n². For example, He⁺ has an ionization energy of 13.6 × 4 = 54.4 eV from its ground state. The Bohr model's successful prediction of the ionization energy of hydrogen was one of its major achievements and provided strong support for the concept of quantized energy levels in atoms."

  question: 'According to the Bohr model, how does the radius of electron orbits in hydrogen vary with the principal quantum number n?'
  options:
  - Radius is proportional to n²
  - Radius is proportional to n
  - Radius is proportional to 1/n
  - Radius is proportional to 1/n²
  correct_answer: Radius is proportional to n²
  explanation: "In Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom, the radius of the nth orbit is given by the formula: rₙ = 0.529n²/Z Å, where n is the principal quantum number, Z is the atomic number, and 0.529 Å is the Bohr radius (radius of the first orbit in hydrogen). This shows that the orbital radius is directly proportional to n². For hydrogen (Z=1): r₁ = 0.529 Å (first orbit), r₂ = 0.529 × 4 = 2.116 Å (second orbit), r₃ = 0.529 × 9 = 4.761 Å (third orbit), and so on. This quadratic relationship means that as n increases, the orbits get much larger very quickly. The first Bohr orbit (n=1) has a radius of about 0.53 Ångströms, while the tenth orbit (n=10) has a radius 100 times larger. This explains why excited states are much larger than the ground state. The derivation of this formula comes from balancing the centripetal force with the electrostatic attraction and applying Bohr's quantization condition (mvr = nh/2π). For hydrogen-like ions with nuclear charge Z, the radius decreases as 1/Z because increased nuclear charge pulls electrons closer. Understanding this relationship is crucial for predicting atomic sizes and explaining trends in the periodic table."
