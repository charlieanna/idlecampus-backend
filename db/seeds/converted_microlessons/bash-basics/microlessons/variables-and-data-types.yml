  # Variables and Data Types in Bash

  ## Introduction

  Variables are fundamental to any programming language, including Bash. In shell scripting, variables allow you to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout your script.

  ## Variable Declaration

  In Bash, you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. Simply assign a value to a variable name:

  ```bash
  name="John"
  age=25
  ```

  **Important rules:**
  - No spaces around the `=` sign
  - Variable names are case-sensitive
  - Use letters, numbers, and underscores (cannot start with a number)

  ## String Variables

  Strings can be defined with single quotes, double quotes, or no quotes:

  ```bash
  greeting='Hello World'
  message="Welcome to Bash"
  simple=test
  ```

  **Difference between quotes:**
  - Single quotes (`'`): Treat everything literally
  - Double quotes (`"`): Allow variable substitution

  ```bash
  name="Alice"
  echo 'Hello $name'  # Outputs: Hello $name
  echo "Hello $name"  # Outputs: Hello Alice
  ```

  ## Accessing Variables

  Use the `$` symbol to access variable values:

  ```bash
  username="developer"
  echo $username
  echo "User is: $username"
  echo "User is: ${username}"  # Preferred for clarity
  ```

  ## Numeric Operations

  Bash treats all variables as strings by default. For arithmetic operations, use `$(( ))`:

  ```bash
  x=10
  y=5
  sum=$((x + y))
  echo "Sum: $sum"  # Outputs: Sum: 15

  # Other operations
  diff=$((x - y))
  product=$((x * y))
  quotient=$((x / y))
  remainder=$((x % y))
  ```

  ## Command Substitution

  You can store command output in variables:

  ```bash
  current_date=$(date)
  files=$(ls -l)
  user_count=$(who | wc -l)
  ```

  ## Environment Variables

  Environment variables are available to child processes. Common ones include:
  - `$HOME`: User's home directory
  - `$PATH`: Command search path
  - `$USER`: Current username
  - `$PWD`: Present working directory

  Set environment variables with `export`:

  ```bash
  export DATABASE_URL="localhost:5432"
  ```

  ## Best Practices

  1. Use meaningful variable names: `user_count` instead of `uc`
  2. Use uppercase for environment variables: `DATABASE_URL`
  3. Use lowercase for local variables: `temp_file`
  4. Always quote variables to prevent word splitting: `"$var"`

      1. Declares variables for firstname, lastname, and birth_year
      2. Calculates the person's age (use current year 2024)
      3. Creates a full_name variable combining first and last name
