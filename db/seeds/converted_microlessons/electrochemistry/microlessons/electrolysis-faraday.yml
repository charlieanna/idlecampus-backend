  \ of Electrolysis\n\n    ### First Law:\n\n    **Statement:** Mass deposited/liberated\
  \ is directly proportional to quantity of electricity passed\n\n    **m ∝ Q**\n\
  \    **m = ZQ** or **m = Zit**\n\n    Where:\n    - m = mass deposited (g)\n   \
  \ - Q = charge (coulombs, C)\n    - i = current (amperes, A)\n    - t = time (seconds,\
  \ s)\n    - Z = electrochemical equivalent (g/C)\n\n    ### Second Law:\n\n    **Statement:**\
  \ When same quantity of electricity passes through different electrolytes, masses\
  \ deposited are proportional to their equivalent weights\n\n    **m₁/m₂ = E₁/E₂**\n\
  \n    Where E = equivalent weight\n\n    ### Combined Form:\n\n    **m = (E × i\
  \ × t) / (96,500)**\n\n    Or: **m = (E × Q) / F**\n\n    Or: **m = (M × i × t)\
  \ / (n × F)**\n\n    Where:\n    - M = molar mass (g/mol)\n    - n = number of electrons\n\
  \    - F = 96,500 C/mol (Faraday constant)\n    - E = M/n = equivalent weight\n\n\
  \    ## Electrochemical Equivalent (Z)\n\n    **Definition:** Mass deposited by\
  \ 1 coulomb of charge\n\n    **Z = E/F = M/(nF)**\n\n    Where:\n    - E = equivalent\
  \ weight\n    - M = molar mass\n    - n = charge on ion\n    - F = 96,500 C/mol\n\
  \n    ### Example: For Cu²⁺\n\n    M = 63.5 g/mol, n = 2\n\n    Z = 63.5/(2 × 96,500)\
  \ = 3.29 × 10⁻⁴ g/C\n\n    ## Moles of Electrons\n\n    **Number of moles of electrons\
  \ = Q/F = it/F**\n\n    **Number of electrons = Q/e** (where e = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C)\n\
  \n    ## Quantitative Calculations\n\n    ### Problem 1: Mass deposited\n\n    **Q:\
  \ A current of 5 A is passed through CuSO₄ for 30 minutes. Calculate mass of Cu\
  \ deposited. (Cu = 63.5, n = 2)**\n\n    Solution:\n    - i = 5 A\n    - t = 30\
  \ × 60 = 1800 s\n    - Q = it = 5 × 1800 = 9000 C\n\n    m = MQ/(nF) = (63.5 × 9000)/(2\
  \ × 96,500)\n    m = 571,500/193,000 = **2.96 g**\n\n    ### Problem 2: Time required\n\
  \n    **Q: How long should 2 A current be passed to deposit 1.08 g Ag? (Ag = 108)**\n\
  \n    Solution:\n    - m = 1.08 g\n    - M = 108, n = 1\n    - i = 2 A\n\n    m\
  \ = Mit/(nF)\n    1.08 = (108 × 2 × t)/(1 × 96,500)\n    t = (1.08 × 96,500)/216\
  \ = **482.5 s ≈ 8 min**\n\n    ### Problem 3: Current\n\n    **Q: What current is\
  \ needed to deposit 3.17 g Cu in 1 hour? (Cu = 63.5, n = 2)**\n\n    Solution:\n\
  \    - m = 3.17 g\n    - t = 3600 s\n\n    m = Mit/(nF)\n    3.17 = (63.5 × i ×\
  \ 3600)/(2 × 96,500)\n    i = (3.17 × 2 × 96,500)/(63.5 × 3600)\n    i = **2.67\
  \ A**\n\n    ### Problem 4: Second law\n\n    **Q: Same charge deposits 0.54 g Ag\
  \ and x g Cu. Find x. (Ag = 108, Cu = 63.5)**\n\n    Solution:\n    - For Ag: E₁\
  \ = 108/1 = 108\n    - For Cu: E₂ = 63.5/2 = 31.75\n\n    m₁/m₂ = E₁/E₂\n    0.54/x\
  \ = 108/31.75\n    x = (0.54 × 31.75)/108 = **0.159 g**\n\n    ## Applications of\

  question: 'A current of 5 A is passed through a CuSO₄ solution for 30 minutes. What mass of copper will be deposited at the cathode? (Cu = 63.5 g/mol, F = 96,500 C/mol, n = 2)'
  options:
  - 2.96 g
  - 5.92 g
  - 1.48 g
  - 4.44 g
  correct_answer: 2.96 g
  explanation: "This problem demonstrates the application of Faraday's first law of electrolysis, which states that the mass of substance deposited or liberated at an electrode is directly proportional to the quantity of electricity passed through the electrolyte. The formula is: m = Mit/(nF), where M is molar mass, i is current, t is time in seconds, n is the number of electrons transferred, and F is Faraday's constant (96,500 C/mol). Given: i = 5 A, t = 30 min = 30 × 60 = 1800 s, M = 63.5 g/mol, n = 2 (since Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu). First, calculate the charge: Q = it = 5 × 1800 = 9000 C. Now apply the formula: m = (63.5 × 5 × 1800)/(2 × 96,500) = 571,500/193,000 = 2.96 g. This calculation shows that approximately 3 grams of copper will be deposited. The number of electrons (n = 2) is crucial because Cu²⁺ ions require 2 electrons each to be reduced to metallic copper. This type of calculation is fundamental in electroplating, electrorefining, and quantitative analysis in electrochemistry."

  question: 'Which statement correctly describes the key difference between galvanic and electrolytic cells?'
  options:
  - In galvanic cells, the anode is positive, while in electrolytic cells, the anode is negative
  - Galvanic cells convert chemical energy to electrical energy, while electrolytic cells convert electrical energy to chemical energy
  - Oxidation occurs at the cathode in galvanic cells but at the anode in electrolytic cells
  - Galvanic cells require an external voltage source, while electrolytic cells do not
  correct_answer: Galvanic cells convert chemical energy to electrical energy, while electrolytic cells convert electrical energy to chemical energy
  explanation: "The fundamental difference between galvanic (voltaic) and electrolytic cells lies in the direction of energy conversion and the spontaneity of reactions. Galvanic cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy through spontaneous redox reactions (ΔG < 0, E°cell > 0). Examples include batteries like the Daniel cell. Electrolytic cells, conversely, convert electrical energy into chemical energy by driving non-spontaneous reactions (ΔG > 0, E°cell < 0) using an external power source. Examples include the electrolysis of water or electroplating. However, it's crucial to note that in BOTH types of cells, oxidation always occurs at the anode and reduction at the cathode (\"An Ox, Red Cat\"). The difference in electrode polarity is: in galvanic cells, the anode is negative (electron source) and cathode is positive (electron sink); in electrolytic cells, the anode is connected to the positive terminal of the external battery and the cathode to the negative terminal. Understanding this distinction is essential for predicting reaction directions, calculating cell potentials, and applying electrochemistry in practical applications like batteries, corrosion prevention, and metal extraction."

  question: 'During the electrolysis of aqueous CuSO₄ solution using platinum electrodes, which species will be preferentially discharged at the cathode and anode respectively?'
  options:
  - Cu²⁺ at cathode; SO₄²⁻ at anode
  - H⁺ at cathode; SO₄²⁻ at anode
  - Cu²⁺ at cathode; OH⁻/H₂O at anode
  - H⁺ at cathode; OH⁻/H₂O at anode
  correct_answer: Cu²⁺ at cathode; OH⁻/H₂O at anode
  explanation: "Preferential discharge in electrolysis is governed by the relative ease of oxidation or reduction of different species present in the solution. At the cathode (reduction), the order of preference is determined by standard electrode potentials: species with higher reduction potential are reduced first. The order is: Au³⁺ > Ag⁺ > Cu²⁺ > H⁺ > Pb²⁺ > Fe²⁺ > Zn²⁺ > Na⁺ > K⁺. In aqueous CuSO₄, we have Cu²⁺ (E° = +0.34 V) and H⁺ from water (E° = 0 V). Since Cu²⁺ has higher reduction potential, it is preferentially reduced: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu. At the anode (oxidation), the order of preference for oxidation is: S²⁻ > I⁻ > Br⁻ > Cl⁻ > OH⁻ > NO₃⁻ > SO₄²⁻. In this case, we have SO₄²⁻ and OH⁻/H₂O from water. SO₄²⁻ is very difficult to oxidize (it's already highly oxidized), so instead, water is oxidized: 2H₂O → O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻. The result is copper deposition at the cathode and oxygen gas evolution at the anode. This principle is crucial for understanding electrolytic processes and predicting products in electrochemical cells."
