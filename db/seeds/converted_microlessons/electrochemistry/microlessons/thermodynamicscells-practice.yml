  question: 'For a cell with E° = 1.10 V and n = 2, calculate ΔG° in kJ. Use F = 96,500 C/mol.'
  options:
  - '-212.3 kJ'
  - '+212.3 kJ'
  - '-106.15 kJ'
  - '-424.6 kJ'
  correct_answer: '-212.3 kJ'
  explanation: "Using the relationship ΔG° = -nFE°, where n = 2 moles of electrons, F = 96,500 C/mol (Faraday constant), and E° = 1.10 V: ΔG° = -2 × 96,500 × 1.10 = -212,300 J = -212.3 kJ. The negative value indicates the reaction is spontaneous (as expected since E° is positive). Note: 1 volt = 1 joule per coulomb, so the units work out: mol × (C/mol) × V = C × V = J."

  question: 'What is the relationship between Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) and standard cell potential (E°)?'
  options:
  - ΔG° = -nFE°
  - ΔG° = nFE°
  - ΔG° = -nE°/F
  - ΔG° = nF/E°
  correct_answer: ΔG° = -nFE°
  explanation: "The fundamental relationship is ΔG° = -nFE°, where ΔG° is standard Gibbs free energy change, n is moles of electrons transferred, F is Faraday's constant (96,500 C/mol), and E° is standard cell potential. The negative sign indicates that: when E° > 0 (spontaneous cell), ΔG° < 0 (spontaneous reaction); when E° < 0 (non-spontaneous cell), ΔG° > 0 (non-spontaneous reaction). At equilibrium, ΔG° = 0 and E° = 0."

  question: 'If ΔG° for a cell reaction is -150 kJ and n = 3, what is E°? (F = 96,500 C/mol)'
  options:
  - '+0.518 V'
  - '-0.518 V'
  - '+1.554 V'
  - '-1.554 V'
  correct_answer: '+0.518 V'
  explanation: "Using ΔG° = -nFE°, we can solve for E°: E° = -ΔG°/(nF). Given ΔG° = -150 kJ = -150,000 J, n = 3, F = 96,500 C/mol: E° = -(-150,000)/(3 × 96,500) = 150,000/289,500 = 0.518 V. The positive E° value indicates a spontaneous reaction, which is consistent with the negative ΔG° value. Remember: negative ΔG° corresponds to positive E° for galvanic (spontaneous) cells."
