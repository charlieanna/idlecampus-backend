  \ Law and Electrochemical Devices\n\n    ## Electrical Conductance\n\n    **Conductance\
  \ (G):** Ability to conduct electricity\n\n    **G = 1/R** (reciprocal of resistance)\n\
  \n    **Units:** Siemens (S) or mho (℧) or Ω⁻¹\n\n    ### Ohm's Law:\n\n    **V\
  \ = IR** or **R = V/I**\n\n    **Conductance: G = I/V = 1/R**\n\n    ## Specific\
  \ Conductance (κ - kappa)\n\n    **Definition:** Conductance of 1 cm³ solution between\
  \ electrodes 1 cm apart\n\n    **κ = (1/R) × (l/A) = G × (l/A)**\n\n    Where:\n\
  \    - l = distance between electrodes (cm)\n    - A = area of electrodes (cm²)\n\
  \    - l/A = cell constant (G*)\n\n    **κ = G × G***\n\n    **Units:** S cm⁻¹ or\
  \ Ω⁻¹ cm⁻¹\n\n    ### Cell Constant (G*):\n\n    **G* = l/A** (depends on geometry\
  \ of cell)\n\n    **Units:** cm⁻¹\n\n    Determined using solution of known κ (KCl\
  \ solution)\n\n    ## Molar Conductivity (Λm)\n\n    **Definition:** Conductance\
  \ of solution containing 1 mole of electrolyte placed between electrodes 1 cm apart\n\
  \n    **Λm = κ × 1000 / M**\n\n    Where:\n    - κ = specific conductance (S cm⁻¹)\n\
  \    - M = molarity (mol/L)\n    - 1000 = conversion factor (1 L = 1000 cm³)\n\n\
  \    **Units:** S cm² mol⁻¹\n\n    ### Equivalent Conductivity (Λeq):\n\n    **Λeq\
  \ = κ × 1000 / N**\n\n    Where N = normality\n\n    **Relationship:** Λm = n ×\
  \ Λeq (n = number of charges)\n\n    ## Variation of Conductivity with Dilution\n\
  \n    ### Specific Conductance (κ):\n\n    **Decreases with dilution** (fewer ions\
  \ per unit volume)\n\n    ### Molar Conductivity (Λm):\n\n    **Increases with dilution**\
  \ (less inter-ionic interactions)\n\n    **Strong electrolytes:** Λm increases slightly\
  \ with dilution\n    **Weak electrolytes:** Λm increases sharply with dilution\n\
  \n    At **infinite dilution:** Λm = Λm° (maximum value)\n\n    ## Kohlrausch's\
  \ Law of Independent Migration\n\n    **Statement:** At infinite dilution, molar\
  \ conductivity is sum of contributions from individual ions\n\n    **Λm° = λ₊° +\
  \ λ₋°**\n\n    Where:\n    - λ₊° = limiting molar conductivity of cation\n    -\
  \ λ₋° = limiting molar conductivity of anion\n\n    ### For Salt:\n\n    **Λm°(NaCl)\
  \ = λ°(Na⁺) + λ°(Cl⁻)**\n\n    ### For Acid/Base:\n\n    **Λm°(HCl) = λ°(H⁺) + λ°(Cl⁻)**\n\
  \    **Λm°(NaOH) = λ°(Na⁺) + λ°(OH⁻)**\n\n    ## Applications of Kohlrausch's Law\n\
  \n    ### 1. Calculate Λm° of weak electrolyte:\n\n    **Example:** Find Λm°(CH₃COOH)\n\
  \n    **Method:**\n    Λm°(CH₃COOH) = λ°(CH₃COO⁻) + λ°(H⁺)\n\n    Cannot measure\
  \ directly, so use:\n\n    **Λm°(CH₃COOH) = Λm°(CH₃COONa) + Λm°(HCl) - Λm°(NaCl)**\n\
  \n    Proof:\n    - Λm°(CH₃COONa) = λ°(CH₃COO⁻) + λ°(Na⁺)\n    - Λm°(HCl) = λ°(H⁺)\
  \ + λ°(Cl⁻)\n    - Λm°(NaCl) = λ°(Na⁺) + λ°(Cl⁻)\n\n    Adding first two and subtracting\
  \ third:\n    = λ°(CH₃COO⁻) + λ°(H⁺) ✓\n\n    ### 2. Degree of Dissociation (α):\n\
  \n    For weak electrolyte:\n\n    **α = Λm / Λm°**\n\n    Where:\n    - Λm = molar\
  \ conductivity at given concentration\n    - Λm° = limiting molar conductivity\n\
  \n    ### 3. Dissociation Constant (Ka):\n\n    For weak acid HA:\n\n    **Ka =\
  \ (Cα²)/(1-α) ≈ Cα²** (if α << 1)\n\n    Since α = Λm/Λm°:\n\n    **Ka = C(Λm/Λm°)²\
  \ / (1 - Λm/Λm°)**\n\n    ## Numerical Examples\n\n    ### Problem 1: Calculate\
  \ κ\n\n    **Q: R = 100 Ω, G* = 0.5 cm⁻¹. Calculate κ.**\n\n    Solution:\n    -\
  \ G = 1/R = 1/100 = 0.01 S\n    - κ = G × G* = 0.01 × 0.5\n    - **κ = 0.005 S cm⁻¹**\n\
  \n    ### Problem 2: Calculate Λm\n\n    **Q: κ = 0.0025 S cm⁻¹, M = 0.1 M. Calculate\
  \ Λm.**\n\n    Solution:\n    Λm = (κ × 1000)/M = (0.0025 × 1000)/0.1\n    **Λm\
  \ = 25 S cm² mol⁻¹**\n\n    ### Problem 3: Kohlrausch's law\n\n    **Q: Calculate\
  \ Λm°(NH₄OH) given:**\n    - Λm°(NH₄Cl) = 150 S cm² mol⁻¹\n    - Λm°(NaOH) = 248\
  \ S cm² mol⁻¹\n    - Λm°(NaCl) = 126 S cm² mol⁻¹\n\n    Solution:\n    Λm°(NH₄OH)\
  \ = Λm°(NH₄Cl) + Λm°(NaOH) - Λm°(NaCl)\n    = 150 + 248 - 126\n    **= 272 S cm²\
  \ mol⁻¹**\n\n    ### Problem 4: Degree of dissociation\n\n    **Q: For CH₃COOH,\
  \ Λm = 18 S cm² mol⁻¹, Λm° = 390 S cm² mol⁻¹. Find α.**\n\n    Solution:\n    α\
  \ = Λm/Λm° = 18/390\n    **α = 0.046 or 4.6%**\n\n    ### Problem 5: Calculate Ka\n\
  \n    **Q: For 0.01 M CH₃COOH, α = 0.04, find Ka.**\n\n    Solution:\n    Ka = Cα²/(1-α)\
  \ = (0.01 × 0.04²)/(1-0.04)\n    Ka = (0.01 × 0.0016)/0.96\n    **Ka = 1.67 × 10⁻⁵**\n\

  question: 'Using Kohlrausch''s law, calculate the limiting molar conductivity (Λm°) of NH₄OH given: Λm°(NH₄Cl) = 150 S cm² mol⁻¹, Λm°(NaOH) = 248 S cm² mol⁻¹, and Λm°(NaCl) = 126 S cm² mol⁻¹.'
  options:
  - 272 S cm² mol⁻¹
  - 398 S cm² mol⁻¹
  - 122 S cm² mol⁻¹
  - 524 S cm² mol⁻¹
  correct_answer: 272 S cm² mol⁻¹
  explanation: "According to Kohlrausch's law of independent migration of ions, the limiting molar conductivity at infinite dilution is the sum of individual ionic conductivities: Λm° = λ₊° + λ₋°. For weak electrolytes like NH₄OH, we cannot measure Λm° directly, so we use an indirect method. We need Λm°(NH₄OH) = λ°(NH₄⁺) + λ°(OH⁻). We can obtain this by the algebraic combination: Λm°(NH₄OH) = Λm°(NH₄Cl) + Λm°(NaOH) - Λm°(NaCl). This works because: Λm°(NH₄Cl) gives us λ°(NH₄⁺) + λ°(Cl⁻), Λm°(NaOH) gives us λ°(Na⁺) + λ°(OH⁻), and Λm°(NaCl) gives us λ°(Na⁺) + λ°(Cl⁻). When we add the first two and subtract the third, the Na⁺ and Cl⁻ terms cancel out, leaving only λ°(NH₄⁺) + λ°(OH⁻). Calculation: 150 + 248 - 126 = 272 S cm² mol⁻¹. This method is fundamental for determining conductivities of weak electrolytes and is widely used in electrochemistry."

  question: 'What happens to specific conductance (κ) and molar conductivity (Λm) when a strong electrolyte solution is progressively diluted?'
  options:
  - Both κ and Λm increase
  - κ decreases while Λm increases
  - κ increases while Λm decreases
  - Both κ and Λm decrease
  correct_answer: κ decreases while Λm increases
  explanation: "The behavior of conductance parameters with dilution reveals important insights into electrolyte solutions. Specific conductance (κ) is the conductance of 1 cm³ of solution between electrodes 1 cm apart. As dilution increases, the number of ions per unit volume decreases, resulting in fewer charge carriers per unit volume. Therefore, κ decreases with dilution. On the other hand, molar conductivity (Λm = κ × 1000/M) is the conductance of a solution containing 1 mole of electrolyte between electrodes. Although κ decreases, the decrease in concentration (M) is proportionally larger, so Λm increases. For strong electrolytes, which are already fully dissociated, Λm increases slightly with dilution because inter-ionic interactions and electrophoretic effects decrease, allowing ions to move more freely. At infinite dilution, Λm reaches its maximum value (Λm°) where inter-ionic interactions are negligible. This relationship is expressed as: Λm = Λm° - A√C for strong electrolytes, where A is a constant and C is concentration. Understanding this behavior is crucial for applying Kohlrausch's law and calculating dissociation constants."

  question: 'In a lead-acid battery during discharge, what is the overall reaction taking place?'
  options:
  - Pb + PbO₂ + 2H₂SO₄ → 2PbSO₄ + 2H₂O
  - 2PbSO₄ + 2H₂O → Pb + PbO₂ + 2H₂SO₄
  - Pb + 2H₂SO₄ → PbSO₄ + 2H₂O + SO₂
  - PbO₂ + H₂SO₄ → Pb + H₂O + SO₃
  correct_answer: Pb + PbO₂ + 2H₂SO₄ → 2PbSO₄ + 2H₂O
  explanation: "The lead-acid battery is the most common secondary (rechargeable) battery used in automobiles. During discharge (providing electrical energy), the battery acts as a galvanic cell with spontaneous redox reactions. At the anode (Pb), oxidation occurs: Pb + SO₄²⁻ → PbSO₄ + 2e⁻. At the cathode (PbO₂), reduction occurs: PbO₂ + 4H⁺ + SO₄²⁻ + 2e⁻ → PbSO₄ + 2H₂O. The overall reaction is: Pb + PbO₂ + 2H₂SO₄ → 2PbSO₄ + 2H₂O. Notice that both electrodes are converted to PbSO₄ (lead sulfate), and sulfuric acid is consumed while water is produced. This explains why the specific gravity of the electrolyte decreases during discharge, which is used to monitor battery charge level. Each cell produces about 2V, so a 12V car battery contains 6 cells in series. During charging, the reverse reaction occurs: electrical energy is used to convert PbSO₄ back to Pb and PbO₂, regenerating H₂SO₄. The ability to reverse this reaction makes the lead-acid battery rechargeable and highly practical for automotive applications."
