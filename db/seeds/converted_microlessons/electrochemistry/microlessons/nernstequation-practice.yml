  Concentration cells have same electrodes at both ends, so E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode
  = 0. EMF comes only from concentration difference via Nernst equation.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'For concentration cell with same electrodes but different concentrations,
    E°cell is:'
  options:
  - 0 V
  - Positive
  - Negative
  - Depends on concentration
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 0 V
  explanation: 'For a concentration cell with the same electrodes at both anode and
    cathode, E°_cell = E°_cathode - E°_anode = 0 V because both electrodes have identical
    standard reduction potentials. The EMF of a concentration cell arises ONLY from
    the concentration difference, not from different electrode materials. The Nernst
    equation for concentration cells: E_cell = (RT/nF) × ln([dilute]/[concentrated])
    or E_cell = (0.059/n) × log([dilute]/[concentrated]) at 25°C. Example: Cu(s)|Cu²⁺(0.01M)||Cu²⁺(1M)|Cu(s)
    gives E_cell = (0.059/2) × log(0.01/1) = -0.059 V. The cell potential depends
    on concentration ratio, and the cell operates until concentrations equalize (equilibrium),
    at which point E_cell = 0.'

  question: 'The Nernst equation at 25°C is: E_cell = E°_cell - (0.059/n) × log Q. What does ''n'' represent?'
  options:
  - Number of electrons transferred in the cell reaction
  - Number of moles of product
  - Avogadro's number
  - Number of ions in solution
  correct_answer: Number of electrons transferred in the cell reaction
  explanation: "In the Nernst equation, 'n' represents the number of moles of electrons transferred in the balanced cell reaction. For example, in the reaction Zn + Cu²⁺ → Zn²⁺ + Cu, n = 2 because two electrons are transferred. The factor 0.059/n comes from (2.303RT)/(nF) at 25°C, where R is the gas constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and F is Faraday's constant (96,500 C/mol). A larger n makes the cell potential less sensitive to concentration changes."

  question: 'According to the Nernst equation, what happens to the cell potential (E_cell) when the reaction quotient Q increases?'
  options:
  - E_cell decreases
  - E_cell increases
  - E_cell remains constant
  - E_cell becomes zero
  correct_answer: E_cell decreases
  explanation: "From the Nernst equation E_cell = E°_cell - (0.059/n) × log Q, as Q increases, the term (0.059/n) × log Q increases, which means E_cell decreases. This makes sense: Q = [products]/[reactants], so when Q increases (more products, fewer reactants), the reaction is closer to equilibrium and the driving force (cell potential) decreases. At equilibrium, Q = K and E_cell = 0. When Q < 1 (excess reactants), E_cell > E°_cell. When Q > 1 (excess products), E_cell < E°_cell."
