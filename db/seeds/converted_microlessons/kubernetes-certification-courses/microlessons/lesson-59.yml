  question: What does '500m' mean when specifying CPU resources in Kubernetes?
  options:
  - 500 megabytes
  - 500 millicores (0.5 CPU cores)
  - 500 cores
  - 500 milliseconds
  correct_answer: 500 millicores (0.5 CPU cores)
  explanation: 'In Kubernetes, CPU is specified in cores, and ''500m'' means 500 millicores,
    which equals 0.5 CPU cores (half a core). 1000m = 1 core. You can also specify
    CPU as a decimal like 0.5, which is equivalent to 500m. One CPU core corresponds
    to 1 AWS vCPU, 1 GCP Core, 1 Azure vCore, or 1 hyperthread on a bare-metal processor.
    CPU is a compressible resource - if a container exceeds its CPU limit, it''s throttled
    (slowed down) but not killed. This is different from memory, which is incompressible.
    CPU requests are used by the scheduler to find nodes with sufficient capacity,
    while limits enforce maximum usage via cgroups. Setting appropriate CPU values
    is crucial: too low causes performance issues, too high wastes cluster resources
    and increases costs.'

  question: What are the three QoS (Quality of Service) classes in Kubernetes?
  options:
  - Low, Medium, High
  - Guaranteed, Burstable, BestEffort
  - Critical, Normal, Low
  - Premium, Standard, Economy
  correct_answer: Guaranteed, Burstable, BestEffort
  explanation: 'Kubernetes assigns pods one of three QoS classes based on resource
    requests and limits: (1) Guaranteed - all containers have memory and CPU limits
    set, and requests equal limits. These are highest priority and last to be evicted.
    (2) Burstable - at least one container has memory or CPU requests or limits set,
    but doesn''t meet Guaranteed criteria. Medium priority. (3) BestEffort - no containers
    have any requests or limits set. Lowest priority, first to be evicted under resource
    pressure. QoS affects eviction order when nodes run out of resources - BestEffort
    pods are evicted first, then Burstable (starting with those using the most resources
    beyond requests), and finally Guaranteed. This mechanism helps Kubernetes make
    informed decisions about which pods to evict during resource contention, protecting
    critical workloads.'

  question: What kubectl command checks if you can perform an action?
  options:
  - kubectl auth can-i create pods
  - kubectl check permissions create pods
  - kubectl verify action create pods
  - kubectl test auth create pods
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: kubectl auth can-i <action> <resource> checks if the current user has
    permission to perform the specified action.
