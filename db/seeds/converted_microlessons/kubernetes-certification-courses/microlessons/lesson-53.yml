  question: What is the primary purpose of an Ingress in Kubernetes?
  options:
  - To provide persistent storage for pods
  - To expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the
    cluster
  - To manage pod-to-pod communication
  - To schedule pods on nodes
  correct_answer: To expose HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services
    within the cluster
  explanation: Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that manages external HTTP/HTTPS access
    to services within the cluster. It provides HTTP routing rules based on hostnames
    and paths, allowing you to expose multiple services through a single IP address
    or load balancer. For example, you can route 'api.example.com' to an API service
    and 'web.example.com' to a web frontend service, both through the same Ingress.
    Ingress supports features like TLS termination, path-based routing, virtual hosting,
    and load balancing. Unlike LoadBalancer Services (which require one external IP
    per service), Ingress consolidates external access, reducing costs and complexity.
    However, Ingress is just a configuration resource - you need an Ingress Controller
    (like nginx-ingress, Traefik, or Istio Gateway) actually running in the cluster
    to implement the Ingress rules and route traffic accordingly.

  question: What is the difference between pathType Prefix and Exact in Ingress rules?
  options:
  - Prefix matches only the root path; Exact matches all paths
  - Prefix matches the path and all subpaths; Exact matches only the specific path
  - There is no difference
  - Prefix is case-sensitive; Exact is case-insensitive
  correct_answer: Prefix matches the path and all subpaths; Exact matches only the
    specific path
  explanation: 'The pathType field in Ingress rules determines how paths are matched.
    ''Exact'' matches only the specific path - ''/app'' matches only ''/app'', not
    ''/app/page'' or ''/application''. ''Prefix'' matches the path and all subpaths
    - ''/app'' matches ''/app'', ''/app/page'', ''/app/foo/bar'', etc. There''s also
    ''ImplementationSpecific'' which delegates matching to the Ingress Controller.
    For example, if you want to route all API calls starting with ''/api/'' to an
    API service, use pathType: Prefix with path: ''/api''. If you want to route only
    exactly ''/api'' (perhaps for a health check endpoint), use pathType: Exact. Prefix
    matching uses path segment boundaries, so ''/app'' with Prefix matches ''/app/page''
    but not ''/application'' (different segment). This distinction is important for
    correctly routing traffic in microservices architectures.'

  question: What kubectl command checks if you can perform an action?
  options:
  - kubectl auth can-i create pods
  - kubectl check permissions create pods
  - kubectl verify action create pods
  - kubectl test auth create pods
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: kubectl auth can-i <action> <resource> checks if the current user has
    permission to perform the specified action.
