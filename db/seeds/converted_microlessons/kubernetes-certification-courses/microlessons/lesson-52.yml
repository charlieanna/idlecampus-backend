  question: What is the DNS name format for accessing a Kubernetes Service from within
    the same namespace?
  options:
  - service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local
  - service-name only
  - service-name.cluster.local
  - namespace.service-name
  correct_answer: service-name only
  explanation: When accessing a Service from pods in the same namespace, you can use
    just the service name (e.g., 'mysql' or 'api-server'). Kubernetes DNS automatically
    resolves this within the same namespace. The fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
    is 'service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local', but the short form works within
    the same namespace due to DNS search paths configured in /etc/resolv.conf in each
    pod. From a different namespace, you need at least 'service-name.namespace'. The
    DNS search list typically includes variations like '<namespace>.svc.cluster.local'
    and 'svc.cluster.local'. CoreDNS is the default DNS server in modern Kubernetes
    clusters, replacing kube-dns. Using short names simplifies configuration and makes
    applications more portable between namespaces, though FQDNs are more explicit
    and can prevent ambiguity in complex setups.

  question: What does CoreDNS do in a Kubernetes cluster?
  options:
  - Manages pod networking
  - Provides DNS-based service discovery by resolving service names to cluster IPs
  - Allocates IP addresses to pods
  - Manages ingress traffic
  correct_answer: Provides DNS-based service discovery by resolving service names
    to cluster IPs
  explanation: CoreDNS is the DNS server for Kubernetes clusters, enabling service
    discovery through DNS. When you create a Service, CoreDNS automatically creates
    DNS records so pods can discover and connect to services by name rather than hardcoded
    IPs. It resolves queries like 'mysql.default.svc.cluster.local' to the Service's
    cluster IP. CoreDNS runs as pods (typically as a Deployment) in the kube-system
    namespace and is configured via a ConfigMap. It supports plugins for features
    like caching, forwarding to upstream DNS servers, custom stub domains for specific
    namespaces, and rewriting DNS queries. CoreDNS replaced kube-dns as the default
    DNS solution because it's more flexible, has better performance, and uses fewer
    resources. All pods are automatically configured to use CoreDNS via /etc/resolv.conf
    entries set by the kubelet.

  question: What is the default service type in Kubernetes?
  options:
  - ClusterIP
  - NodePort
  - LoadBalancer
  - ExternalName
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: ClusterIP is the default service type. It exposes the service on an
    internal cluster IP, making it only reachable within the cluster.
