  question: What does CrashLoopBackOff indicate about a pod?
  options:
  - The image cannot be pulled
  - The container repeatedly crashes and Kubernetes is backing off on restart attempts
  - The pod is waiting to be scheduled
  - The node is NotReady
  correct_answer: The container repeatedly crashes and Kubernetes is backing off on
    restart attempts
  explanation: 'CrashLoopBackOff means a container is starting, crashing, and being
    restarted repeatedly. Kubernetes implements exponential backoff between restart
    attempts (10s, 20s, 40s, up to 5 minutes) to avoid overwhelming the system. Common
    causes include application bugs, missing dependencies, incorrect configuration,
    failed health checks, or resource issues. To troubleshoot: use ''kubectl describe
    pod'' to see events and exit codes, ''kubectl logs <pod>'' for application output,
    and ''kubectl logs <pod> --previous'' for logs from the crashed container. The
    exit code in pod status provides clues - exit code 137 suggests OOMKilled, 1 indicates
    application error. Understanding why containers crash requires examining both
    Kubernetes events and application logs to identify the root cause.'

  question: What does ImagePullBackOff status mean?
  options:
  - The image is too large
  - Kubernetes failed to pull the container image and is retrying with backoff
  - The container runtime is not working
  - The image is corrupted
  correct_answer: Kubernetes failed to pull the container image and is retrying with
    backoff
  explanation: 'ImagePullBackOff indicates Kubernetes repeatedly failed to pull the
    container image from the registry and is using exponential backoff between retry
    attempts. Common causes include: incorrect image name or tag, authentication issues
    (missing or invalid imagePullSecrets for private registries), network problems
    reaching the registry, registry being unavailable or rate-limited, or the image
    not existing. Use ''kubectl describe pod'' to see detailed error messages. Verify
    the image name and tag are correct, ensure imagePullSecrets are properly configured
    for private registries, and test network connectivity to the registry. You can
    manually test image pulls on the node using crictl or docker to isolate whether
    it''s a Kubernetes configuration issue or a registry/network problem. Always use
    specific image tags rather than ''latest'' to avoid unpredictable behavior.'

  question: What command lists all pods in all namespaces?
  options:
  - kubectl get pods -A
  - kubectl list pods --all
  - kubectl get pods --everywhere
  - kubectl pods list -A
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: kubectl get pods -A (or --all-namespaces) lists pods across all namespaces.
    The -A flag is shorthand for --all-namespaces.
