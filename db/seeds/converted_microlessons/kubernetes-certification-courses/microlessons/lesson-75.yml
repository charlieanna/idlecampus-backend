  question: What authentication method uses X.509 certificates to identify users?
  options:
  - Bearer tokens
  - OIDC
  - Client certificates
  - Basic authentication
  correct_answer: Client certificates
  explanation: Client certificate authentication uses X.509 certificates to identify
    users to the Kubernetes API server. The certificate's Common Name (CN) becomes
    the username, and Organization (O) fields become groups. The API server validates
    certificates against a configured CA. This method is secure and commonly used
    for cluster administrators and automated tools. Certificates are typically located
    in ~/.kube/config or specified via kubectl flags. While secure, certificate management
    can be challenging - distribution, rotation, and revocation require careful processes.
    Client certs are often used in combination with RBAC for authorization. Modern
    clusters increasingly use OIDC or other dynamic authentication methods for users,
    reserving client certs for service accounts and system components due to simpler
    management and better audit capabilities.

  question: What is OIDC authentication in Kubernetes?
  options:
  - A built-in Kubernetes user database
  - Integration with external identity providers like Google, Azure AD, or Okta for
    authentication
  - A certificate-based authentication system
  - A deprecated authentication method
  correct_answer: Integration with external identity providers like Google, Azure
    AD, or Okta for authentication
  explanation: OIDC (OpenID Connect) authentication allows Kubernetes to integrate
    with external identity providers (IdPs) like Google, Azure AD, Okta, or Keycloak.
    Users authenticate with the IdP, receive an ID token, and present it to Kubernetes.
    The API server validates the token against the IdP's public keys. This enables
    centralized user management, single sign-on (SSO), and integration with corporate
    identity systems. OIDC tokens contain claims like username and groups which map
    to Kubernetes principals for RBAC. This is more scalable than client certificates
    for many users as it leverages existing identity infrastructure, supports MFA,
    and provides better audit trails. Configure OIDC via API server flags like --oidc-issuer-url,
    --oidc-client-id, and --oidc-username-claim. OIDC is recommended for production
    clusters with multiple human users.

  question: What kubectl command checks if you can perform an action?
  options:
  - kubectl auth can-i create pods
  - kubectl check permissions create pods
  - kubectl verify action create pods
  - kubectl test auth create pods
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: kubectl auth can-i <action> <resource> checks if the current user has
    permission to perform the specified action.
