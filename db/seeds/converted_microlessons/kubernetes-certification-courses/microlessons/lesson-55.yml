  question: What is the primary role of sidecar proxies in a service mesh?
  options:
  - To replace the application container
  - To intercept and manage all network traffic to and from the application container
  - To store application logs
  - To provide persistent storage
  correct_answer: To intercept and manage all network traffic to and from the application
    container
  explanation: In a service mesh architecture, a sidecar proxy (like Envoy in Istio
    or Linkerd-proxy in Linkerd) is automatically injected alongside each application
    container. This proxy intercepts all inbound and outbound network traffic for
    the application, enabling the service mesh to provide features like traffic management,
    observability, and security without modifying application code. The proxy handles
    service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaking, retries, timeouts, and metrics
    collection. The collection of all these sidecar proxies forms the data plane,
    while the control plane (like Istio's istiod) configures the proxies. This pattern
    allows centralized management of cross-cutting concerns - developers focus on
    business logic while the service mesh handles networking complexity. The transparent
    interception is typically achieved using iptables rules that redirect traffic
    to the proxy.

  question: What is mutual TLS (mTLS) in the context of service mesh?
  options:
  - Encryption of traffic only from client to server
  - Two-way authentication where both client and server verify each other's certificates
  - A method to compress network traffic
  - A load balancing algorithm
  correct_answer: Two-way authentication where both client and server verify each
    other's certificates
  explanation: 'Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a security feature where both the client and
    server authenticate each other using TLS certificates, unlike standard TLS where
    only the server is authenticated. In a service mesh, mTLS is automatically enabled
    between services, providing encryption in transit and strong identity verification.
    When Service A calls Service B, the service mesh ensures: (1) both services have
    valid certificates issued by the mesh''s certificate authority, (2) traffic is
    encrypted, and (3) both parties verify each other''s identity. This provides zero-trust
    security within the cluster - services can''t communicate unless they have valid
    mesh identities. Service meshes like Istio automate certificate management, rotation,
    and enforcement. mTLS prevents man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and unauthorized
    access between services, which is crucial for compliance and security in multi-tenant
    or sensitive environments.'

  question: What kubectl command checks if you can perform an action?
  options:
  - kubectl auth can-i create pods
  - kubectl check permissions create pods
  - kubectl verify action create pods
  - kubectl test auth create pods
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: kubectl auth can-i <action> <resource> checks if the current user has
    permission to perform the specified action.
