  question: What service account does a pod use if no service account is specified?
  options:
  - No service account
  - The cluster-admin service account
  - The default service account in the pod's namespace
  - A randomly generated service account
  correct_answer: The default service account in the pod's namespace
  explanation: 'If you don''t specify a serviceAccountName in a pod spec, Kubernetes
    automatically assigns the ''default'' service account from the pod''s namespace.
    Every namespace has a default service account created automatically. This service
    account has minimal permissions by default (in many setups, it can''t even list
    or read most resources). The service account token is automatically mounted at
    /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token, allowing the pod to authenticate
    to the Kubernetes API. For applications that don''t need API access, you can disable
    token mounting with automountServiceAccountToken: false. For applications that
    do need API access, create a dedicated service account with specific RBAC permissions
    rather than using the default. This follows the principle of least privilege -
    give each application only the permissions it needs.'

  question: How do you grant a service account permissions to access Kubernetes resources?
  options:
  - By adding the service account to a Group
  - By creating a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding that binds a Role/ClusterRole
    to the service account
  - By modifying the service account's manifest
  - Permissions are granted automatically
  correct_answer: By creating a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding that binds a Role/ClusterRole
    to the service account
  explanation: 'To grant a service account permissions, you create a RoleBinding (namespace-scoped)
    or ClusterRoleBinding (cluster-wide) that binds a Role or ClusterRole to the service
    account. For example, to allow service account ''app-sa'' to list pods in the
    ''production'' namespace, you''d create a Role with ''get/list'' verbs on ''pods'',
    then a RoleBinding connecting that Role to ''app-sa''. The binding''s subjects
    field references the service account: ''kind: ServiceAccount, name: app-sa, namespace:
    production''. ClusterRoleBindings grant cluster-wide permissions. This RBAC model
    provides fine-grained control over what each application can do via the Kubernetes
    API. Service accounts themselves don''t have permissions - they''re just identities.
    Permissions come from the Role/ClusterRole they''re bound to via bindings.'

  question: What is the default service type in Kubernetes?
  options:
  - ClusterIP
  - NodePort
  - LoadBalancer
  - ExternalName
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: ClusterIP is the default service type. It exposes the service on an
    internal cluster IP, making it only reachable within the cluster.
