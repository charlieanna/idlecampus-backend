  question: What is the difference between the baseline and restricted Pod Security
    Standards?
  options:
  - Baseline allows privileged containers, restricted does not
  - Baseline prevents known privilege escalations, restricted enforces hardened security
    best practices
  - They are the same
  - Baseline is deprecated
  correct_answer: Baseline prevents known privilege escalations, restricted enforces
    hardened security best practices
  explanation: 'Pod Security Standards define three policies: (1) Privileged - unrestricted,
    for trusted workloads, (2) Baseline - minimally restrictive, prevents known privilege
    escalations like hostNetwork, hostPID, hostPath, privileged containers, and dangerous
    capabilities, suitable for most applications, and (3) Restricted - heavily restricted,
    enforces current security best practices including running as non-root, read-only
    root filesystem, dropping all capabilities, and preventing privilege escalation.
    Baseline is a practical middle ground that blocks obvious security issues while
    allowing most common applications. Restricted is for security-sensitive workloads
    requiring maximum hardening. Apply these standards at the namespace level using
    Pod Security Admission controller. Choose based on workload sensitivity and security
    requirements. Most applications can run under baseline; restricted requires careful
    application design.'

  question: How do you enforce Pod Security Standards in a namespace?
  options:
  - Using RBAC policies
  - Using Pod Security Admission labels on the namespace
  - Using NetworkPolicies
  - Using ResourceQuotas
  correct_answer: Using Pod Security Admission labels on the namespace
  explanation: 'Pod Security Standards are enforced using Pod Security Admission controller
    by adding labels to namespaces. Three labels control enforcement: pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce
    (blocks violating pods), pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit (logs violations but
    allows pods), and pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn (warns users about violations).
    Each label specifies a level: privileged, baseline, or restricted. For example,
    ''pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted'' prevents creation of pods that
    don''t meet restricted standards. Use audit and warn modes for testing before
    enforcing. You can set different levels for each mode - enforce baseline while
    warning about restricted violations to encourage gradual hardening. Pod Security
    Admission replaced PodSecurityPolicy (deprecated in 1.21, removed in 1.25) with
    a simpler, more maintainable approach to pod security.'

  question: What command lists all pods in all namespaces?
  options:
  - kubectl get pods -A
  - kubectl list pods --all
  - kubectl get pods --everywhere
  - kubectl pods list -A
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: kubectl get pods -A (or --all-namespaces) lists pods across all namespaces.
    The -A flag is shorthand for --all-namespaces.
