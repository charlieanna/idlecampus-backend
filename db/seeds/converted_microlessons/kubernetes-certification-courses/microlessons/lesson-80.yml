  question: What happens to a PersistentVolume with a reclaim policy of Delete when
    its bound PVC is deleted?
  options:
  - The PV and underlying storage are automatically deleted
  - The PV is retained for manual cleanup
  - The PV is recycled for reuse
  - Nothing happens
  correct_answer: The PV and underlying storage are automatically deleted
  explanation: When a PersistentVolume has a reclaimPolicy of Delete and its bound
    PersistentVolumeClaim is deleted, both the PV object and the underlying storage
    resource (e.g., AWS EBS volume, GCE Persistent Disk) are automatically deleted.
    This is the default for dynamically provisioned volumes and is convenient but
    potentially dangerous - accidental PVC deletion leads to permanent data loss.
    The Retain policy keeps both the PV and underlying storage after PVC deletion,
    requiring manual cleanup but preventing accidental data loss. The Recycle policy
    (deprecated) performs a basic scrub (rm -rf) and makes the PV available for new
    claims. For production data, many teams use Retain or implement backup strategies
    before allowing Delete. Understanding reclaim policies is critical for data protection.

  question: What does the ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode mean for a PersistentVolume?
  options:
  - Multiple pods can mount the volume, but only one can write
  - The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes simultaneously
  - The volume can be written by the cluster admin only
  - The volume supports automatic replication
  correct_answer: The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes simultaneously
  explanation: ReadWriteMany (RWX) access mode allows a volume to be mounted as read-write
    by pods on multiple nodes simultaneously. This is required for applications like
    shared file servers or distributed applications where multiple pods across different
    nodes need write access to the same storage. Not all storage types support RWX
    - it typically requires network file systems like NFS, CephFS, or GlusterFS. ReadWriteOnce
    (RWO) allows mounting by pods on a single node only (most common, supported by
    block storage like EBS, Azure Disk). ReadOnlyMany (ROX) allows read-only mounts
    by pods on many nodes. Choose the access mode based on your application's needs
    and your storage backend's capabilities. Attempting to use RWX with storage that
    doesn't support it will cause PVC to remain Pending.

  question: What kubectl command checks if you can perform an action?
  options:
  - kubectl auth can-i create pods
  - kubectl check permissions create pods
  - kubectl verify action create pods
  - kubectl test auth create pods
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: kubectl auth can-i <action> <resource> checks if the current user has
    permission to perform the specified action.
