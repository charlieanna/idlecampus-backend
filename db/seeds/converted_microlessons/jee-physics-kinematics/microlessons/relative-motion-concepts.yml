  # Relative Motion and Reference Frames

  ## Concept of Relative Motion

  **All motion is relative** - it depends on the observer's frame of reference.

  ### Relative Velocity Formula:
  ```
  v⃗_AB = v⃗_A - v⃗_B

  (Velocity of A with respect to B)
  ```

  ### Key Properties:
  - v⃗_AB = -v⃗_BA
  - |v⃗_AB| ≠ |v⃗_A| - |v⃗_B| (in general)
  - For parallel motion: v_rel = v₁ - v₂
  - For antiparallel motion: v_rel = v₁ + v₂
  - For perpendicular: v_rel = √(v₁² + v₂²)

  ## 1D Relative Motion

  ### Same Direction:
  ```
  v_rel = v₁ - v₂

  Example: Car A (60 km/h) behind Car B (40 km/h)
  v_AB = 60 - 40 = 20 km/h (approaching)
  ```

  ### Opposite Direction:
  ```
  v_rel = v₁ + v₂

  Example: Two trains approaching
  v_rel = 100 + 80 = 180 km/h
  ```

  ## 2D Relative Motion

  ### Vector Addition/Subtraction:
  ```
  v⃗_AB = v⃗_A - v⃗_B

  |v⃗_AB| = √(v_A² + v_B² - 2v_Av_B cos θ)
  ```

  Where θ is angle between v⃗_A and v⃗_B.

  ## River-Boat Problems

  ### Key Terms:
  - **v_b** = velocity of boat in still water
  - **v_r** = velocity of river current
  - **v_br** = velocity of boat relative to river
  - **v_bg** = velocity of boat relative to ground

  ```
  v⃗_bg = v⃗_br + v⃗_r
  ```

  ### Case 1: Crossing River (Shortest Path)
  Boat must head upstream at angle θ:
  ```
  sin θ = v_r/v_b
  v_net = √(v_b² - v_r²)
  Time = d/v_net = d/√(v_b² - v_r²)
  ```

  **Condition:** v_b > v_r (else impossible)

  ### Case 2: Crossing River (Minimum Time)
  Boat heads perpendicular to river:
  ```
  Time = d/v_b (minimum)
  Drift = v_r × t = v_r × d/v_b
  ```

  ### Case 3: Going Downstream
  ```
  v_net = v_b + v_r
  ```

  ### Case 4: Going Upstream
  ```
  v_net = v_b - v_r
  ```

  ## Rain-Man Problems

  ### When Man is Stationary:
  Rain falls at velocity v⃗_r

  ### When Man Moves:
  ```
  v⃗_rm = v⃗_r - v⃗_m (rain velocity w.r.t. man)

  tan θ = v_m/v_r (apparent angle from vertical)
  ```

  ### Umbrella Angle:
  To stay dry, hold umbrella at angle θ = tan⁻¹(v_m/v_r) from vertical

  ## Collision Problems

  ### Time to Collision:
  ```
  t = Distance/Relative velocity

  t = |r⃗_AB|/|v⃗_AB|
  ```

  ### Closest Approach:
  For two objects moving with velocities v⃗_A and v⃗_B:
  1. Find relative velocity v⃗_BA
  2. Find component of separation along v⃗_BA
  3. Minimum distance when relative position ⊥ relative velocity

  ## Reference Frames

  ### Inertial Frame:
  - Newton's laws valid
  - Non-accelerating
  - Examples: Ground (approx), space far from masses

  ### Non-Inertial Frame:
  - Accelerating
  - Pseudo forces appear
  - Examples: Accelerating car, rotating Earth

  ### Galilean Transformation:
  ```
  x' = x - vt (for S' moving at v relative to S)
  v' = v - V
  a' = a (acceleration same in all inertial frames)
  ```

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** A boat can travel at 5 km/h in still water. River flows at 3 km/h. Find time to cross 400m wide river by shortest path.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  Shortest path → Perpendicular crossing
  v_net = √(5² - 3²) = √16 = 4 km/h
  d = 400 m = 0.4 km
  t = 0.4/4 = 0.1 h = 6 minutes
  ```

  **Example 2:** Rain falls vertically at 10 m/s. A man walks at 5 m/s. At what angle should he hold umbrella?

  **Solution:**
  ```
  tan θ = v_man/v_rain = 5/10 = 0.5
  θ = tan⁻¹(0.5) ≈ 26.57°

  Hold umbrella at 26.57° from vertical (in direction of motion)
  ```

  **Example 3:** Two cars A and B are 100 km apart. A moves East at 60 km/h, B moves North at 80 km/h. Find minimum distance between them.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  v⃗_BA = v⃗_B - v⃗_A = 80ĵ - 60î
  |v⃗_BA| = √(80² + 60²) = 100 km/h

  Using geometry of closest approach:
  Minimum distance = perpendicular distance from A to trajectory of B relative to A
  ```

  ## JEE Important Points

  1. **Relative velocity is vector subtraction**
  2. **River problems**: Draw velocity triangle
  3. **Rain problems**: Man's motion affects apparent angle
  4. **Collision**: Use relative motion to simplify
  5. **Same acceleration → Constant relative velocity**

  question: "A boat takes 2 hours to travel from A to B downstream and 4 hours to return upstream. The ratio of speed of boat to speed of current is:"
  options:
  - "2:1"
  - "3:1"
  - "4:1"
  - "5:1"
  correct_answer: "3:1"
  explanation: "Let boat speed = v_b, current = v_r, distance = d. Downstream: d/(v_b + v_r) = 2. Upstream: d/(v_b - v_r) = 4. From first equation: d = 2(v_b + v_r). From second: d = 4(v_b - v_r). Equating: 2(v_b + v_r) = 4(v_b - v_r), so 2v_b + 2v_r = 4v_b - 4v_r, giving 6v_r = 2v_b, hence v_b/v_r = 3/1 = 3:1. This is a classic river problem - downstream time is always less than upstream time, and the ratio depends on speed of current relative to boat."

  question: "Rain falls vertically with velocity 20 m/s. A person runs with velocity 15 m/s. The angle at which rain appears to fall to him is:"
  options:
  - "tan⁻¹(3/4)"
  - "tan⁻¹(4/3)"
  - "sin⁻¹(3/4)"
  - "cos⁻¹(4/5)"
  correct_answer: "tan⁻¹(3/4)"
  explanation: "Relative velocity of rain w.r.t. man: v⃗_rm = v⃗_r - v⃗_m. Rain velocity is 20 m/s downward, man's velocity is 15 m/s horizontal. In man's frame: vertical component = 20 m/s (down), horizontal component = 15 m/s (backward). tan θ = horizontal/vertical = 15/20 = 3/4. So θ = tan⁻¹(3/4) ≈ 36.87° from vertical. The man should hold umbrella at this angle ahead to stay dry. Note: If man runs faster, rain appears more horizontal."

  question: "Two trains 120 m and 80 m long are running in opposite directions with speeds 42 km/h and 30 km/h. Time to completely pass each other is:"
  options:
  - "5 s"
  - "10 s"
  - "15 s"
  - "20 s"
  correct_answer: "10 s"
  explanation: "Total distance to cover = sum of lengths = 120 + 80 = 200 m. Relative speed (opposite directions) = 42 + 30 = 72 km/h = 72 × (5/18) = 20 m/s. Time = Distance/Speed = 200/20 = 10 s. For passing in same direction, relative speed = |42-30| = 12 km/h, time would be longer. Key insight: When trains move in opposite directions, their relative speed is maximum (sum of speeds), making passing time minimum. This is why head-on collisions are most dangerous."
