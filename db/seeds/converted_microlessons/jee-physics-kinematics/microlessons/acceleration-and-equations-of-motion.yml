  # Acceleration and Equations of Motion

  ## Acceleration

  **Definition:** Rate of change of velocity with respect to time.

  ### Mathematical Expression:
  ```
  a⃗ = dv⃗/dt = d²r⃗/dt²

  Average acceleration: a_avg = Δv/Δt = (v₂ - v₁)/(t₂ - t₁)
  ```

  ### Properties:
  - **Vector quantity** (magnitude + direction)
  - SI unit: **m/s²**
  - Dimensions: [LT⁻²]
  - Can be positive (speeding up) or negative (slowing down)

  ## Types of Acceleration

  ### 1. Uniform Acceleration
  - Constant magnitude and direction
  - Velocity changes equally in equal time intervals
  - Example: Free fall, motion on inclined plane

  ### 2. Non-uniform Acceleration
  - Changes with time or position
  - a = f(t) or a = f(x)
  - Example: SHM, projectile motion (direction changes)

  ### 3. Centripetal Acceleration
  - Directed towards center of circular path
  - a = v²/r = ω²r
  - Changes direction continuously

  ## Equations of Motion (SUVAT)

  For **uniformly accelerated motion** in one dimension:

  ### First Equation:
  ```
  v = u + at
  ```
  (Velocity-time relation)

  ### Second Equation:
  ```
  s = ut + ½at²
  ```
  (Displacement-time relation)

  ### Third Equation:
  ```
  v² = u² + 2as
  ```
  (Velocity-displacement relation)

  ### Additional Useful Equations:
  ```
  s = ((u + v)/2) × t
  s = vt - ½at²
  sₙ = u + a(n - ½)  (displacement in nth second)
  ```

  ## Sign Convention

  Choose positive direction:
  - **Along motion**: acceleration positive if speeding up
  - **Against motion**: acceleration negative (retardation)
  - **Vertical**: Usually up positive, down negative (or vice versa)

  **Important:** Be consistent throughout problem!

  ## Graphical Analysis

  ### 1. Position-Time (x-t) Graph
  - **Slope = Velocity**
  - Straight line → Uniform velocity
  - Parabola → Uniform acceleration
  - Slope increasing → Positive acceleration

  ### 2. Velocity-Time (v-t) Graph
  - **Slope = Acceleration**
  - **Area under curve = Displacement**
  - Horizontal line → Zero acceleration
  - Inclined line → Uniform acceleration

  ### 3. Acceleration-Time (a-t) Graph
  - **Area under curve = Change in velocity**
  - Horizontal line → Uniform acceleration
  - Above x-axis → Positive acceleration

  ## Important Relations from Graphs

  ```
  v = dx/dt (slope of x-t graph)
  a = dv/dt (slope of v-t graph)
  x = ∫v dt (area under v-t graph)
  v = ∫a dt (area under a-t graph)
  ```

  ## Motion Under Gravity

  ### Free Fall (downward positive):
  ```
  v = u + gt
  h = ut + ½gt²
  v² = u² + 2gh
  ```

  ### Thrown Upward (upward positive):
  ```
  v = u - gt
  h = ut - ½gt²
  v² = u² - 2gh

  Time to reach max height: t = u/g
  Max height: H = u²/(2g)
  Time of flight: T = 2u/g
  ```

  ## JEE Important Concepts

  ### 1. Displacement in nth Second:
  ```
  sₙ = u + ½a(2n - 1)

  Ratio s₁:s₂:s₃:... = 1:3:5:7:... (if u = 0)
  ```

  ### 2. Stopping Distance:
  ```
  s = u²/(2a)  (when v = 0)

  s ∝ u²  (distance ∝ square of initial speed)
  ```

  ### 3. Average Velocity:
  ```
  For uniform acceleration:
  v_avg = (u + v)/2 = u + ½at

  NOT equal to (v₁ + v₂)/2 in general!
  ```

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** A car accelerates from rest at 2 m/s² for 10s, then moves with uniform velocity for 20s, then decelerates at 4 m/s² until rest. Find total distance.

  **Solution:**
  Phase 1 (acceleration):
  ```
  v = 0 + 2(10) = 20 m/s
  s₁ = 0 + ½(2)(10)² = 100 m
  ```

  Phase 2 (uniform):
  ```
  s₂ = 20(20) = 400 m
  ```

  Phase 3 (deceleration):
  ```
  0² = 20² - 2(4)s₃
  s₃ = 400/8 = 50 m
  ```

  Total: s = 100 + 400 + 50 = **550 m**

  **Example 2:** A ball dropped from height h reaches ground in time t. At what height was it at t/2?

  **Solution:**
  ```
  h = ½gt²  ... (1)

  At t/2: h' = ½g(t/2)² = ½gt²/4 = h/4

  Height from ground = h - h/4 = 3h/4
  ```

  ## Common JEE Mistakes

  1. ❌ Forgetting to square (t/2) in kinematic equations
  2. ❌ Wrong sign convention for acceleration
  3. ❌ Confusing distance with displacement
  4. ❌ Using average formula for non-uniform acceleration
  5. ❌ Not converting units (km/h to m/s)

  **Conversion:** 1 km/h = 5/18 m/s

  question: "A body starts from rest and moves with uniform acceleration. The ratio of distances covered in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd seconds is:"
  options:
  - "1:2:3"
  - "1:3:5"
  - "1:4:9"
  - "1:1:1"
  correct_answer: "1:3:5"
  explanation: "For uniformly accelerated motion from rest: sₙ = u + ½a(2n-1) = 0 + ½a(2n-1) = a(n-½). So s₁ = a(1-½) = a/2, s₂ = a(2-½) = 3a/2, s₃ = a(3-½) = 5a/2. Ratio: (a/2):(3a/2):(5a/2) = 1:3:5. This is the famous 'odd number sequence' for equal time intervals starting from rest. Total distance in n seconds: s = ½an², giving s₁:s₂:s₃ = 1:4:9 (cumulative). But distance IN each second follows 1:3:5:7..."

  question: "A car moving at 72 km/h applies brakes and stops in 5 seconds. The retardation is:"
  options:
  - "2 m/s²"
  - "4 m/s²"
  - "14.4 m/s²"
  - "72 m/s²"
  correct_answer: "4 m/s²"
  explanation: "First convert: 72 km/h = 72 × (5/18) = 20 m/s. Using v = u + at: 0 = 20 + a(5), so a = -4 m/s². The negative sign indicates deceleration (retardation). Magnitude of retardation = 4 m/s². Stopping distance = v²-u²/(2a) = (0-400)/(2×-4) = 50 m. This is a practical example - at higher speeds, both stopping time and distance increase significantly. If speed doubles, stopping distance quadruples (s ∝ u²)."

  question: "From the top of a tower, a stone is dropped and another is thrown vertically downward with velocity 10 m/s. After 2s, the distance between them is:"
  options:
  - "10 m"
  - "20 m"
  - "40 m"
  - "5 m"
  correct_answer: "20 m"
  explanation: "For dropped stone: s₁ = 0 + ½gt² = ½(10)(4) = 20 m. For thrown stone: s₂ = 10(2) + ½(10)(4) = 20 + 20 = 40 m. Separation = s₂ - s₁ = 40 - 20 = 20 m. Alternative method: The difference in initial velocities = 10 m/s. In 2 seconds, extra distance = 10 × 2 = 20 m. Since both have same acceleration (g), their separation increases linearly with time. This principle is used in relative motion - when two objects have same acceleration, their relative velocity remains constant."
