  # Motion Graphs and Graphical Analysis

  ## Importance of Graphs

  Graphs provide visual representation of motion, making it easier to:
  - Understand relationships between variables
  - Extract information (slope, area)
  - Solve complex problems without equations

  ## Displacement-Time (s-t) Graph

  ### Slope = Velocity
  ```
  v = ds/dt = slope of s-t graph
  ```

  ### Types:
  | Graph Shape | Motion Type | Velocity |
  |-------------|-------------|----------|
  | Horizontal line | At rest | v = 0 |
  | Straight line (positive slope) | Uniform velocity | v = constant > 0 |
  | Straight line (negative slope) | Uniform velocity | v = constant < 0 |
  | Parabola (concave up) | Uniformly accelerated | v increasing |
  | Parabola (concave down) | Uniformly decelerated | v decreasing |
  | Curve | Non-uniform motion | v varying |

  ### Important:
  - Steeper slope = higher velocity
  - Negative slope = moving backward
  - Slope cannot be infinite (instant displacement)

  ## Velocity-Time (v-t) Graph

  ### Slope = Acceleration
  ```
  a = dv/dt = slope of v-t graph
  ```

  ### Area = Displacement
  ```
  s = ∫v dt = area under v-t curve
  ```

  ### Types:
  | Graph Shape | Motion Type | Acceleration |
  |-------------|-------------|--------------|
  | Horizontal line | Uniform velocity | a = 0 |
  | Straight line (positive slope) | Uniform acceleration | a = constant > 0 |
  | Straight line (negative slope) | Uniform deceleration | a = constant < 0 |
  | Curve | Variable acceleration | a changing |

  ### Important:
  - Area above t-axis = positive displacement
  - Area below t-axis = negative displacement
  - Net area = net displacement

  ## Acceleration-Time (a-t) Graph

  ### Area = Change in Velocity
  ```
  Δv = ∫a dt = area under a-t curve
  ```

  ### Types:
  - Horizontal line: Constant acceleration
  - Step function: Sudden change in acceleration
  - Varying curve: Variable acceleration

  ## Summary of Relationships

  ```
  s-t graph: Slope → v, cannot give area directly
  v-t graph: Slope → a, Area → s
  a-t graph: Area → Δv, cannot give slope meaningfully
  ```

  ## Special Cases

  ### 1. Free Fall (u = 0):
  - s-t: Parabola s = ½gt²
  - v-t: Straight line v = gt
  - a-t: Horizontal line a = g

  ### 2. Projectile (vertical component):
  - v-t: Straight line with negative slope (-g)
  - Crosses zero at maximum height

  ### 3. SHM:
  - s-t: Sinusoidal curve
  - v-t: Cosine curve
  - a-t: Negative sine curve

  ## Distance vs Displacement from Graphs

  From v-t graph:
  - **Displacement** = algebraic sum of areas (+ and -)
  - **Distance** = sum of absolute values of areas

  Example: If area above = 20 m, area below = 10 m:
  - Displacement = 20 - 10 = 10 m
  - Distance = 20 + 10 = 30 m

  ## Average Velocity from Graph

  ```
  v_avg = Total displacement / Total time = Net area / Total time
  ```

  ## Reading Graphs

  ### Questions to Ask:
  1. What is plotted on each axis?
  2. What does slope represent?
  3. What does area represent?
  4. Is the graph continuous? (sudden jumps?)
  5. What are intercepts?

  ## Common Mistakes

  1. ❌ Confusing slope with value
  2. ❌ Ignoring signs of areas
  3. ❌ Thinking curved s-t means curved path
  4. ❌ Forgetting units of slope and area
  5. ❌ Mixing distance and displacement

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** From v-t graph, velocity changes from 10 m/s to 30 m/s in 4 s (straight line). Find displacement and acceleration.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  Acceleration = slope = (30-10)/4 = 5 m/s²

  Displacement = area under curve (trapezoid)
  s = ½(10+30)×4 = 80 m

  OR using equation: s = ut + ½at² = 10(4) + ½(5)(16) = 80 m ✓
  ```

  **Example 2:** Object moves: 0-2s at +5 m/s, 2-5s at -3 m/s. Find displacement and distance.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  Area (0-2s) = 5 × 2 = +10 m
  Area (2-5s) = -3 × 3 = -9 m

  Displacement = 10 - 9 = 1 m
  Distance = 10 + 9 = 19 m

  Object returned most of the way back!
  ```

  **Example 3:** s-t graph is parabola s = 3t². Find velocity at t = 2 s.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  v = ds/dt = 6t
  At t = 2: v = 12 m/s

  This is slope of tangent to parabola at t = 2.
  ```

  ## JEE Key Points

  1. **s-t slope = velocity**
  2. **v-t slope = acceleration, area = displacement**
  3. **a-t area = change in velocity**
  4. **Positive area above axis, negative below**
  5. **Distance ≠ Displacement** when motion reverses
  6. **Tangent slope for instantaneous values**

  question: "In a v-t graph, area under curve between t₁ and t₂ represents:"
  options:
  - "Average velocity"
  - "Average acceleration"
  - "Change in velocity"
  - "Displacement"
  correct_answer: "Displacement"
  explanation: "Area under v-t curve = ∫v dt = displacement. This is fundamental! Think: velocity × time = distance. Area has units (m/s) × s = m. For non-uniform motion, area gives exact displacement that would be complex to calculate otherwise. If velocity is negative (below t-axis), area is negative (backward displacement). This graphical method is powerful: complex motion with varying velocity becomes simple area calculation. For a-t graph: area = ∫a dt = Δv. For s-t graph: slope = v, but area has no direct meaning."

  question: "A particle's s-t graph is a straight line making 45° angle with time axis. The particle:"
  options:
  - "Has zero velocity"
  - "Has constant non-zero velocity"
  - "Has constant acceleration"
  - "Is accelerating"
  correct_answer: "Has constant non-zero velocity"
  explanation: "Straight line in s-t graph means constant slope, hence constant velocity. At 45° angle, slope = tan 45° = 1 (in appropriate units). If axes are scaled equally (same units), velocity = 1 m/s. Horizontal line would mean v = 0 (no displacement). Parabola would indicate acceleration. Curved line means changing velocity. The key insight: s-t graph shows position evolution, its derivative (slope) is velocity. Constant slope = constant velocity = uniform motion. This is first equation of motion: s = ut when a = 0."

  question: "In v-t graph, velocity changes from +20 m/s to -10 m/s in 6 seconds uniformly. Displacement is:"
  options:
  - "30 m"
  - "60 m"
  - "90 m"
  - "15 m"
  correct_answer: "30 m"
  explanation: "This is a straight line from +20 to -10 m/s crossing zero. Area = trapezoid (but one part above, one below). Find when v = 0: Acceleration = (-10-20)/6 = -5 m/s². Time to reach 0: 20 = 5t, t = 4 s. Area (0-4s) = ½ × 20 × 4 = 40 m (triangle, positive). Area (4-6s) = ½ × 10 × 2 = 10 m (triangle, negative). Net displacement = 40 - 10 = 30 m. Distance traveled = 40 + 10 = 50 m. Object moves forward 40 m, then backward 10 m, ending 30 m from start. This demonstrates importance of algebraic addition of areas."
