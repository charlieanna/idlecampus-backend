  # Distance and Displacement: Fundamental Concepts

  ## Introduction

  Understanding the difference between **distance** and **displacement** is crucial for mastering kinematics in JEE Physics.

  ## Definitions

  ### Distance (Scalar)
  - **Total path length** traveled by an object
  - Always **positive** or zero
  - **Scalar quantity** (magnitude only)
  - Denoted as **s** or **d**
  - SI unit: **meter (m)**

  ### Displacement (Vector)
  - **Shortest distance** from initial to final position
  - **Vector quantity** (magnitude + direction)
  - Can be **positive, negative, or zero**
  - Denoted as **Δr** or **s⃗**
  - SI unit: **meter (m)**

  ## Mathematical Representation

  ### In 1D Motion:
  ```
  Displacement = Final position - Initial position
  Δx = x₂ - x₁
  ```

  ### In 2D/3D Motion:
  ```
  Δr⃗ = r⃗₂ - r⃗₁
  |Δr⃗| = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)² + (z₂-z₁)²]
  ```

  ## Key Differences

  | Property | Distance | Displacement |
  |----------|----------|--------------|
  | Type | Scalar | Vector |
  | Sign | Always ≥ 0 | Can be ±ve or 0 |
  | Path dependent | Yes | No |
  | Magnitude | ≥ |Displacement| | ≤ Distance |

  ## Important Relations

  1. **Distance ≥ |Displacement|** (Always)
  2. **Distance = |Displacement|** only for unidirectional motion without return
  3. For **circular path**: Distance = πr, Displacement = 2r (semicircle)
  4. For **complete circle**: Distance = 2πr, Displacement = 0

  ## JEE Important Formulas

  ### Average Speed vs Average Velocity:
  ```
  Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
  v_avg = s/t

  Average Velocity = Total Displacement / Total Time
  v⃗_avg = Δr⃗/Δt
  ```

  ### For Round Trip:
  - Average speed ≠ 0
  - Average velocity = 0

  ## Numerical Example

  **Problem:** A particle moves along x-axis: 0 → 5m → -3m → 7m

  **Solution:**
  - Distance = 5 + 8 + 10 = **23 m**
  - Displacement = 7 - 0 = **7 m** (positive x-direction)
  - Ratio = Distance/Displacement = 23/7 ≈ 3.3

  ## Common JEE Mistakes to Avoid

  1. ❌ Confusing distance with displacement in projectile problems
  2. ❌ Forgetting displacement can be zero when distance is not
  3. ❌ Not considering direction in displacement calculations
  4. ❌ Using distance formula for velocity calculations

  ## JEE Pattern Questions

  **Type 1:** Find ratio of distance to displacement
  **Type 2:** Average speed vs average velocity comparison
  **Type 3:** Displacement in terms of position vectors
  **Type 4:** Maximum displacement problems

  ## Practice Problems

  **Q1:** A car travels 40 km North, then 30 km East. Find:
  (a) Distance traveled
  (b) Magnitude of displacement
  (c) Direction of displacement

  **Solution:**
  (a) Distance = 40 + 30 = **70 km**
  (b) |Δr| = √(40² + 30²) = √(1600 + 900) = √2500 = **50 km**
  (c) tan θ = 30/40 = 0.75, θ = **36.87° East of North**

  question: "A particle moves from A(2,3) to B(5,7) in a straight line. What is the magnitude of displacement?"
  options:
  - "5 units"
  - "7 units"
  - "12 units"
  - "25 units"
  correct_answer: "5 units"
  explanation: "Using the displacement formula: |Δr| = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²] = √[(5-2)² + (7-3)²] = √[9 + 16] = √25 = 5 units. This is the straight-line distance between two points, which represents displacement magnitude. Note that the actual path might be longer (distance ≥ displacement), but displacement only considers initial and final positions."

  question: "A person walks 4 km East, then 3 km North, and finally 4 km West. What is the ratio of distance to displacement?"
  options:
  - "11/3"
  - "3/11"
  - "11/7"
  - "7/11"
  correct_answer: "11/3"
  explanation: "Distance = 4 + 3 + 4 = 11 km (total path length). For displacement: After walking 4 km East and 4 km West, the net horizontal displacement is 0. The vertical displacement is 3 km North. So, |Displacement| = 3 km. Ratio = Distance/Displacement = 11/3. This is a classic JEE problem showing that when horizontal movements cancel, only vertical displacement remains."

  question: "An athlete runs around a circular track of radius 50 m. After completing 1.5 revolutions, what is the ratio of distance covered to the magnitude of displacement?"
  options:
  - "3π/2"
  - "π/2"
  - "3π"
  - "π"
  correct_answer: "3π/2"
  explanation: "For 1.5 revolutions: Distance = 1.5 × 2πr = 3πr = 3π(50) = 150π m. After 1.5 revolutions, the athlete is at the diametrically opposite point from start (0.5 revolution extra after 1 complete). Displacement = diameter = 2r = 100 m. Ratio = 150π/100 = 3π/2. This demonstrates that in circular motion, distance keeps accumulating while displacement depends only on the angular position."
