  - Skip confirmation: docker image prune -f


  - Remove all unused: docker image prune -a'

  question: What are "dangling" images?
  options:
  - Untagged images (showing <none>) from failed builds or replaced tags
  - Images that are corrupted and unusable
  - Images over 1GB in size
  - Images from untrusted sources
  correct_answer: Untagged images (showing <none>) from failed builds or replaced tags
  explanation: "Dangling images are layers that have no tag and aren't referenced by any tagged image. They appear as <none>:<none> in docker images output. They're created when builds fail partway or when you rebuild an image with the same tag (the old version becomes dangling). Use docker image prune to clean them up."
