  \ images: Your Local Image Repository\n\n    ## What is docker images?\n    `docker\
  \ images` displays all Docker images stored locally on your system. It's your inventory\
  \ management tool for tracking downloaded and built images, their sizes, and when\
  \ they were created.\n\n    ## Why Image Management Matters\n    - **Disk Space**:\
  \ Images can consume significant storage\n    - **Version Tracking**: See which\
  \ versions you have locally\n    - **Cleanup Planning**: Identify old or unused\
  \ images\n    - **Build Verification**: Confirm images were created successfully\n\
  \n    ## Common Use Cases\n\n    ### 1. List All Images\n    ```bash\n    docker\
  \ images\n    ```\n    Shows all locally available images.\n\n    ### 2. List Images\
  \ for Specific Repository\n    ```bash\n    docker images nginx\n    ```\n    Shows\
  \ only nginx images with different tags.\n\n    ### 3. Show Image IDs Only\n   \
  \ ```bash\n    docker images -q\n    ```\n    Returns just image IDs for scripting.\n\
  \n    ### 4. Show All Including Intermediates\n    ```bash\n    docker images -a\n\
  \    ```\n    Includes intermediate layers used during builds.\n\n    ## Output\
  \ Columns Explained\n\n    ```\n    REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED\
  \        SIZE\n    nginx         alpine    ae2feff98a0c   2 weeks ago    23.4MB\n\
  \    myapp         1.0       f6d82d3d3a1b   1 hour ago     156MB\n    ```\n\n  \
  \  - **REPOSITORY**: Image name (e.g., nginx, myapp)\n    - **TAG**: Version/variant\
  \ (e.g., latest, 1.0, alpine)\n    - **IMAGE ID**: Unique identifier (first 12 chars\
  \ of SHA256)\n    - **CREATED**: When image was built or pulled\n    - **SIZE**:\
  \ Disk space consumed\n\n    ## Understanding Image Tags\n\n    Same image can have\
  \ multiple tags:\n    ```bash\n    myapp    1.0      abc123...   1 hour ago   156MB\n\
  \    myapp    latest   abc123...   1 hour ago   156MB\n    ```\n    Both tags point\
  \ to the same image ID!\n\n    ## Dangling Images\n\n    Untagged images from failed\
  \ builds or replaced tags:\n    ```bash\n    <none>   <none>   def456...   3 days\
  \ ago   200MB\n    ```\n\n    View only dangling images:\n    ```bash\n    docker\
  \ images -f dangling=true\n    ```\n\n    ## Common Patterns\n\n    ### Find Large\
  \ Images\n    ```bash\n    docker images --format \"{{.Size}}\\t{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}\"\
  \ | sort -h\n    ```\n\n    ### List Images by Date\n    ```bash\n    docker images\
  \ --format \"{{.CreatedAt}}\\t{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}\"\n    ```\n\n    ### Count\
  \ Total Images\n    ```bash\n    docker images | wc -l\n    ```\n\n    ## Pro Tips\n\
  \n    1. Use `-q` flag for piping to other commands\n    2. Filter by repository\
  \ name to find specific images\n    3. Check dangling images regularly for cleanup\n\
  \    4. Use `--format` for custom output in scripts\n    5. Sort by size to find\
  \ storage hogs\n\n## Syntax/Command\n\n```bash\ndocker images\n```\n\n## Example\n\
  \n```bash\ndocker images -a\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n- List all images: docker images\n\
  \n- Only IDs: docker images -q\n\n- Specific repo: docker images <name>"

  question: What does it mean when two images have the same IMAGE ID?
  options:
  - They are the same image with different tags pointing to the same content
  - It is an error condition that should be fixed
  - They are duplicates wasting disk space
  - They just happen to have the same size
  correct_answer: They are the same image with different tags pointing to the same content
  explanation: "When multiple images share the same IMAGE ID, they are actually the same image with different tags. For example, myapp:1.0 and myapp:latest might both point to the same image ID. This doesn't waste space - Docker stores the image layers only once."
