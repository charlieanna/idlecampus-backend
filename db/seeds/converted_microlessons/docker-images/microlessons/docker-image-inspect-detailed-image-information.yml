  question: What information can you find with docker image inspect?
  options:
  - Layers, environment variables, exposed ports, architecture, and creation date
  - Only the image size
  - Running container information
  - Network connections of running containers
  correct_answer: Layers, environment variables, exposed ports, architecture, and creation date
  explanation: "docker image inspect provides comprehensive metadata about an image in JSON format, including layers, environment variables, exposed ports, architecture, OS, creation date, and configuration. It doesn't show runtime information about containers - for that you'd use docker container inspect."
