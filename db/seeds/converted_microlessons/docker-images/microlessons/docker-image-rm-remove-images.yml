  ## Key Points


  - Remove: docker image rm <image>


  - Force: docker image rm -f <image>


  - Multiple: docker image rm img1 img2'

  question: What happens to containers when you force remove their image?
  options:
  - Running containers continue to work but may fail when restarted
  - All containers using the image are automatically stopped
  - Nothing - containers are completely unaffected
  - Containers are automatically recreated from backup
  correct_answer: Running containers continue to work but may fail when restarted
  explanation: "When you force remove an image with -f, existing running containers continue to function because they have their own filesystem layers. However, if you stop and try to restart those containers, they will fail because the base image is gone. It's safer to stop containers before removing their images."
  require_pass: true
