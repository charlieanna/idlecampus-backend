  - Force remove: docker rmi -f <image>

  question: Can you remove an image that has a running container?
  options:
  - No, unless you use the -f flag to force removal
  - Yes, Docker automatically stops the container first
  - Yes, but the container will immediately fail
  - No, it is never possible even with force
  correct_answer: No, unless you use the -f flag to force removal
  explanation: "By default, docker rmi will refuse to remove an image if it's being used by a running container, showing an error like 'image is being used by running container'. You must use -f (force) flag to remove it anyway. However, forcing removal is risky - the container keeps running but may fail if restarted."
