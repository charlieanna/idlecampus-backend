  Carbylamine: R-NH₂ + CHCl₃ + KOH → R-NC (foul smell). ONLY 1° amines give offensive
  smell of isocyanide. 2° and 3° do not react.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'Carbylamine test is positive for:'
  options:
  - 1° amines only
  - 2° amines only
  - All amines
  - 3° amines only
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 1° amines only
  explanation: 'The carbylamine test (also called isocyanide test) is specific for
    primary amines. When a primary amine (R-NH₂) is heated with chloroform (CHCl₃)
    and alcoholic KOH, it forms an isocyanide (R-NC) which has an extremely offensive,
    foul smell. The reaction is: R-NH₂ + CHCl₃ + 3KOH → R-NC + 3KCl + 3H₂O. Secondary
    (2°) and tertiary (3°) amines do not give this reaction because they lack the
    two hydrogen atoms on nitrogen required for the reaction mechanism. This makes
    it a reliable test to distinguish primary amines from secondary and tertiary amines.'

  question: 'What is the characteristic observation in a positive carbylamine test?'
  options:
  - Offensive, foul smell of isocyanide
  - Yellow precipitate
  - Silver mirror
  - Blue color
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Offensive, foul smell of isocyanide
  explanation: 'The characteristic observation in a positive carbylamine test is an extremely offensive, foul smell of the isocyanide (R-NC) formed. When a primary amine is heated with chloroform (CHCl₃) and alcoholic KOH, it produces isocyanide which has one of the most disagreeable odors in organic chemistry - often described as nauseating or putrid. This distinctive smell is so characteristic that it makes the test very reliable. The reaction is: R-NH₂ + CHCl₃ + 3KOH → R-NC (foul smell) + 3KCl + 3H₂O. There is no color change or precipitate - the smell is the diagnostic feature. Secondary and tertiary amines do not produce this smell because they cannot form isocyanides.'

  question: 'Why do secondary and tertiary amines NOT give carbylamine test?'
  options:
  - They lack two hydrogen atoms on nitrogen required for the reaction
  - They are too basic
  - They do not react with chloroform
  - They form different colored products
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: They lack two hydrogen atoms on nitrogen required for the reaction
  explanation: 'Secondary (R₂NH) and tertiary (R₃N) amines do NOT give carbylamine test because they lack the two hydrogen atoms on nitrogen that are required for the reaction mechanism. Primary amines (R-NH₂) have two H atoms on nitrogen. During the carbylamine test, the amine must react with dichlorocarbene (:CCl₂) intermediate generated from chloroform and base. The mechanism requires both H atoms on nitrogen to be substituted/eliminated sequentially to form the isocyanide (R-N≡C:). Secondary amines (R₂NH) have only one H on nitrogen, and tertiary amines (R₃N) have no H on nitrogen, so they cannot complete the reaction sequence. This structural requirement makes the test specific for distinguishing primary amines from other amines.'
