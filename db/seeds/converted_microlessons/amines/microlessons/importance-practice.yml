  question: 'Diazonium salts are important because they:'
  options:
  - Convert aniline to versatile intermediates for phenol, halobenzenes, and azo dyes
  - Form stable compounds at room temperature
  - Only produce chloro and bromo derivatives
  - React exclusively with aliphatic compounds
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Convert aniline to versatile intermediates for phenol, halobenzenes,
    and azo dyes
  explanation: Diazonium salts (Ar-N₂⁺X⁻) are extremely important synthetic intermediates
    because they allow conversion of aniline to a wide variety of products that would
    be difficult to make otherwise. Through Sandmeyer reaction, they can introduce
    Cl, Br, CN; through other reactions they form phenols, iodides, and even fluorides
    (using HBF₄). They also couple with phenols/aromatic amines to form azo dyes.
    This versatility makes them invaluable in organic synthesis despite their instability
    at room temperature.

  question: 'Which of these products CANNOT be obtained from benzenediazonium chloride?'
  options:
  - Benzene
  - Chlorobenzene
  - Phenol
  - Toluene
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Toluene
  explanation: 'Toluene (C₆H₅-CH₃) cannot be obtained from benzenediazonium chloride because there is no direct reaction to introduce a methyl group from diazonium salt. Benzenediazonium chloride can give: (1) Benzene - by reduction with hypophosphorous acid (H₃PO₂), (2) Chlorobenzene - via Sandmeyer reaction with CuCl, (3) Phenol - by warming with water or dilute acid, (4) Bromobenzene - via Sandmeyer with CuBr, (5) Iodobenzene - with KI, (6) Benzonitrile - via Sandmeyer with CuCN, (7) Fluorobenzene - via Balz-Schiemann, and (8) Azo dyes - via coupling reactions. To make toluene from aniline, you would need a completely different synthetic route, not via diazonium salt.'

  question: 'What is the major limitation of diazonium salts in organic synthesis?'
  options:
  - They are unstable at room temperature and must be kept cold
  - They are too expensive to prepare
  - They only work with aliphatic amines
  - They cannot form azo dyes
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: They are unstable at room temperature and must be kept cold
  explanation: 'The major limitation of diazonium salts is their extreme instability at temperatures above 5-10°C. They rapidly decompose at room temperature, losing N₂ gas and forming unwanted byproducts. This means: (1) They must be prepared at 0-5°C (ice-cold conditions), (2) They must be used immediately after preparation, (3) They cannot be stored, and (4) All subsequent reactions must be carried out at low temperature or immediately upon warming. Despite this instability, diazonium salts are invaluable because they provide the only practical route to many substituted benzenes (especially F, CN, I) and are essential for azo dye synthesis. The benefits outweigh the inconvenience of working at low temperature.'
