  question: What is a dangling volume?
  options:
  - A volume that exists but is not currently mounted/used by any containers
  - A volume that has corrupted data
  - A volume that has reached its storage limit
  - A volume that was created without a name (anonymous volume)
  correct_answer: A volume that exists but is not currently mounted/used by any containers
  explanation: "A dangling volume is one that exists on the system but is not referenced by any containers (stopped or running). These often result from containers being removed without the --rm flag or without explicitly removing their volumes. You can list them with 'docker volume ls --filter dangling=true' and clean them up with 'docker volume prune'."
