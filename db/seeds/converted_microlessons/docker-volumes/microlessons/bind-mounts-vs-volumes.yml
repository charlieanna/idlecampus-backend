  Understand the differences between bind mounts and volumes


  ## Syntax/Command


  ```bash

  docker run -v /host/path:/container/path nginx

  ```


  ## Example


  ```bash

  docker run -v $(pwd):/app nginx

  ```


  ## Key Points


  - Bind mount: -v /absolute/host/path:/container/path


  - Current dir: -v $(pwd):/app


  - Explicit: --mount type=bind,source=...,target=...'
exercises:
- type: terminal
  problem_statement: Run an nginx container with a bind mount from /host/path on the host to /container/path inside the container
  expected_output: Container starts with the host directory mounted
  language: bash
  starter_code: "# Run with bind mount\n"
  sequence_order: 1
  command: docker run -v /host/path:/container/path nginx

  question: When should you use bind mounts instead of volumes?
  options:
  - During development to sync code changes between host and container in real-time
  - For production databases requiring maximum reliability
  - For better performance across all platforms
  - For cross-platform compatibility between Windows, Mac, and Linux
  correct_answer: During development to sync code changes between host and container in real-time
  explanation: "Bind mounts are ideal for development because they map a host directory directly into the container, allowing real-time code synchronization. Changes on the host immediately reflect in the container. However, for production use volumes instead: they're Docker-managed, platform-independent, perform better on Windows/Mac, and have better backup/migration tools."
