  question: Where does Docker store volume data by default on Linux?
  options:
  - /var/lib/docker/volumes/ (managed by Docker daemon)
  - /docker/volumes/ (in the root directory)
  - /tmp/docker/volumes/ (in the temporary directory)
  - /opt/docker/volumes/ (in the optional software directory)
  correct_answer: /var/lib/docker/volumes/ (managed by Docker daemon)
  explanation: "On Linux, Docker stores named volumes in /var/lib/docker/volumes/ by default. Each volume gets its own subdirectory with a hash name (for anonymous volumes) or the volume name (for named volumes). This location is managed entirely by Docker and shouldn't be modified directly - use Docker commands instead."
  require_pass: true
