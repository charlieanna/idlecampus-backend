  question: Can you remove a volume that is currently mounted to a running or stopped container?
  options:
  - No, you must remove or stop all containers using the volume first
  - Yes, the container will automatically recreate it when needed
  - Yes, but only if you use the -f (force) flag
  - Only if the container is stopped (not running)
  correct_answer: No, you must remove or stop all containers using the volume first
  explanation: "Docker will refuse to remove a volume that is being used by any container (running or stopped), showing an error like 'volume is in use'. You must first remove the containers using that volume, or at minimum stop them and ensure they're not configured to restart. There is no force flag to override this safety check."
  require_pass: true
