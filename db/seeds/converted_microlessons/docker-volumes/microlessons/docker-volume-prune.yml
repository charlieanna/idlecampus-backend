  question: What volumes does docker volume prune remove?
  options:
  - Only volumes not currently referenced or mounted by any containers (both named and anonymous)
  - Only anonymous volumes regardless of usage
  - Only named volumes that are unused
  - Only volumes created more than 24 hours ago
  correct_answer: Only volumes not currently referenced or mounted by any containers (both named and anonymous)
  explanation: "docker volume prune removes all volumes (both named and anonymous) that are not currently being used by at least one container. A volume is considered 'in use' if any container (running or stopped) has it mounted. This makes it safe to run regularly for cleanup without losing data from existing containers."
