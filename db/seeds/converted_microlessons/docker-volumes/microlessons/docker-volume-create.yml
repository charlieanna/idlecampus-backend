  Create named volumes for persistent data storage


  ## Syntax/Command


  ```bash

  docker volume create my-volume

  ```


  ## Example


  ```bash

  docker volume create --driver local my-volume

  ```


  ## Key Points


  - Create volume: docker volume create <name>


  - Specify driver: --driver <type>


  - Add labels: --label <key>=<value>'
exercises:
- type: terminal
  problem_statement: Create a named Docker volume called 'my-volume' for storing persistent data that survives container deletion
  expected_output: Volume name returned confirming successful creation
  language: bash

  question: Why use named volumes instead of bind mounts?
  options:
  - Volumes are managed by Docker, work across platforms, and have better performance on Windows/Mac
  - Bind mounts are always slower than volumes
  - Volumes require root access but bind mounts don't
  - Bind mounts cannot be shared between multiple containers
  correct_answer: Volumes are managed by Docker, work across platforms, and have better performance on Windows/Mac
  explanation: "Named volumes are managed by Docker (stored in /var/lib/docker/volumes), are portable across operating systems, and perform better on Windows/Mac where bind mounts go through VM layers. Bind mounts directly map host paths, which can be useful for development but are less portable and require explicit host paths."
  require_pass: true
