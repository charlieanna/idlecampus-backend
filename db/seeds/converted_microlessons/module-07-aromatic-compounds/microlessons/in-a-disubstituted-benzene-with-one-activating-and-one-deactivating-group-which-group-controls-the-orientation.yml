  group, which group controls the orientation? 🚀


  When an activating and deactivating group compete, the MORE ACTIVATING group controls
  the orientation. The more activated positions react faster and determine where the
  new substituent goes.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: In a disubstituted benzene with one activating and one deactivating group,
    which group controls the orientation?
  options:
  - The deactivating group
  - The activating group
  - Both equally
  - The larger group
  correct_answer: The activating group
  explanation: "In a disubstituted benzene with one activating and one deactivating group, the more activating group controls the orientation of further substitution. This is because the positions activated by the activating group are much more reactive than those directed by the deactivating group. The reaction follows the path of lowest activation energy, which is attack at the most electron-rich (most activated) positions. For example, in p-nitrotoluene, the activating -CH₃ group dominates over the deactivating -NO₂ group, directing further substitution primarily to the ortho position of the methyl group. The relative reactivity difference between activated and deactivated positions is usually several orders of magnitude."
