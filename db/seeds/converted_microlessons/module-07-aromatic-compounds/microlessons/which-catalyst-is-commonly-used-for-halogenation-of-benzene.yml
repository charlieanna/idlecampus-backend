  Halogenation of benzene requires a Lewis acid catalyst like FeBr₃, FeCl₃, AlBr₃,
  or AlCl₃. These generate the electrophilic X⁺ from X₂.


  ## Key Points

  question: Which catalyst is commonly used for halogenation of benzene?
  options:
  - H₂SO₄
  - FeBr₃ or AlCl₃
  - NaOH
  - Pt/C
  correct_answer: FeBr₃ or AlCl₃
  explanation: "Halogenation of benzene requires Lewis acid catalysts such as FeBr₃, FeCl₃, AlBr₃, or AlCl₃. These catalysts polarize the halogen molecule (X₂) and generate the electrophilic halogen species (X⁺): X₂ + FeX₃ → X⁺ + FeX₄⁻. Without the catalyst, benzene won't react with Br₂ or Cl₂ at room temperature because the halogens aren't electrophilic enough. The catalyst is typically matched to the halogen: FeBr₃ or AlBr₃ for bromination, FeCl₃ or AlCl₃ for chlorination. The iron(III) halide is often generated in situ from iron filings and the halogen."
