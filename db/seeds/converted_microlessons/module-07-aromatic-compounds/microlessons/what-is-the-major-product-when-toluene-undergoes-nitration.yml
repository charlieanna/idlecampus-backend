  Toluene has -CH₃ group which is an ortho/para director and activating. Nitration
  gives a mixture of o-nitrotoluene and p-nitrotoluene (with para usually predominating
  due to less steric hindrance).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the major product when toluene undergoes nitration?
  options:
  - Only m-Nitrotoluene
  - Only o-Nitrotoluene
  - Mixture of o-Nitrotoluene and p-Nitrotoluene
  - Only p-Nitrotoluene
  correct_answer: Mixture of o-Nitrotoluene and p-Nitrotoluene
  explanation: "When toluene undergoes nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄, the -CH₃ (methyl) group acts as an ortho/para director and activating group through its +I (inductive) effect. This directs the incoming nitro group to ortho and para positions, giving a mixture of o-nitrotoluene and p-nitrotoluene. Typically, para isomer predominates (60-70%) over ortho (30-40%) due to less steric hindrance at the para position. Meta-nitrotoluene is formed only in trace amounts (~3%) because the methyl group activates ortho/para positions more than meta. This selectivity is fundamental to understanding electrophilic aromatic substitution directing effects."
