  reactions? 🚀


  Benzene undergoes substitution to maintain its aromatic stability (150 kJ/mol resonance
  energy). Addition would destroy aromaticity, which is energetically unfavorable.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Why does benzene undergo substitution reactions rather than addition reactions?
  options:
  - Benzene has no double bonds
  - Addition reactions would destroy the aromatic stability
  - Benzene is too unreactive for addition
  - Substitution is faster than addition
  correct_answer: Addition reactions would destroy the aromatic stability
  explanation: "Benzene undergoes substitution reactions rather than addition reactions to preserve its aromatic stability. Benzene has exceptional thermodynamic stability due to aromaticity - its resonance stabilization energy is approximately 150 kJ/mol (36 kcal/mol). Addition reactions would convert sp² carbons to sp³, breaking the conjugated π system and destroying the aromaticity. For example, adding Br₂ across a double bond would give a non-aromatic cyclohexadiene, losing the resonance energy. In contrast, electrophilic aromatic substitution replaces an H with another group while maintaining the aromatic sextet of π electrons. The high activation energy for addition (due to loss of aromaticity in intermediates) makes substitution the thermodynamically and kinetically favored pathway."
