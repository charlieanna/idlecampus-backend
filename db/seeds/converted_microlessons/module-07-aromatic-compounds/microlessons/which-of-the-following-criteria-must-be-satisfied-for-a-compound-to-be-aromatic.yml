  be aromatic? 🚀


  For aromaticity: (1) Cyclic ✓ (2) Planar ✓ (3) Conjugated ✓ (4) (4n+2) π electrons,
  not 4n. The 4n rule gives antiaromatic compounds.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following criteria must be satisfied for a compound to be
    aromatic?
  options:
  - Cyclic structure
  - Planar geometry
  - Complete conjugation
  - 4n π electrons where n is an integer
  correct_answer: Complete conjugation
  explanation: "For a compound to be aromatic, it must satisfy ALL of the following criteria: (1) Cyclic structure - must form a ring. (2) Planar geometry - allows p orbital overlap for conjugation. (3) Complete conjugation - uninterrupted system of overlapping p orbitals around the ring. (4) (4n+2) π electrons (Hückel's rule), NOT 4n π electrons. The option '4n π electrons where n is an integer' is INCORRECT - this describes antiaromatic compounds, which are especially unstable. The question asks which criteria must be satisfied, and while all four are required, option 3 (complete conjugation) is correct while option 4 as stated (4n instead of 4n+2) is incorrect. For example, benzene satisfies all criteria: cyclic, planar, conjugated, and has 6 π electrons (4n+2 where n=1)."
