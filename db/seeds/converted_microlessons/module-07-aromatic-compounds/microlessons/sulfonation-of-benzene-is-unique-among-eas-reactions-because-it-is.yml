  🚀


  Sulfonation is the only EAS reaction that is REVERSIBLE. The -SO₃H group can be
  removed by heating with dilute H₂SO₄, making it useful for temporary blocking of
  positions.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  - Does not require a catalyst
  - Forms two products
  correct_answer: Reversible
  explanation: "Sulfonation of benzene is unique among electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions because it is reversible. The sulfonic acid group (-SO₃H) can be removed by heating the arene sulfonic acid with dilute sulfuric acid and steam (desulfonation), regenerating benzene. This reversibility makes sulfonation useful for: (1) temporary blocking of positions during multi-step syntheses, (2) kinetic vs. thermodynamic product control (different temperatures favor different isomers). The reversibility occurs because the S-C bond can be protonated and cleaved under acidic conditions. All other common EAS reactions (nitration, halogenation, Friedel-Crafts alkylation/acylation) are essentially irreversible under normal conditions."
