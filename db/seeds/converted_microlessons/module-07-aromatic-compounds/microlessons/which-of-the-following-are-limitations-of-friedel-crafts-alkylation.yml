  Friedel-Crafts alkylation has three major limitations: (1) Polyalkylation - product
  is more reactive (2) Carbocation rearrangement (3) Does not work on deactivated
  rings (NO₂, COOH, etc.).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following are limitations of Friedel-Crafts alkylation?
  options:
  - Polyalkylation occurs
  - Carbocation rearrangement can occur
  - Does not work on deactivated rings
  - Requires high temperatures
  correct_answer: Does not work on deactivated rings
  explanation: "Friedel-Crafts alkylation has three major limitations: (1) Polyalkylation - the alkylated product is more activated than benzene (due to electron-donating alkyl group), leading to multiple substitutions that are hard to control. (2) Carbocation rearrangement - alkyl carbocations can rearrange to more stable forms (e.g., 1° → 2° → 3°), giving unexpected products. (3) Does not work on deactivated rings - benzene rings with deactivating groups like -NO₂, -COOH, -SO₃H, -CN, or -COR are too electron-poor to undergo Friedel-Crafts reactions. Additionally, it doesn't work on rings with -NH₂ or -OH groups that can coordinate with the Lewis acid catalyst. While the question asks about limitations (plural), option 3 is highlighted as a key limitation."
