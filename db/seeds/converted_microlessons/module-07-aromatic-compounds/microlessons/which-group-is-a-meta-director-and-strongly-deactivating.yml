  -NO₂ (nitro) is a strong meta director and strongly deactivating group due to its
  strong -M and -I effects. It makes the benzene ring much less reactive than benzene.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: Which group is a meta director and strongly deactivating?
  options:
  - -CH₃
  - -OH
  - -NO₂
  - -Cl
  correct_answer: -NO₂
  explanation: "The nitro group (-NO₂) is a meta director and strongly deactivating substituent. It exhibits both strong -M (mesomeric/resonance) effect and -I (inductive) effect, withdrawing electron density from the benzene ring. This makes the ring less nucleophilic and much less reactive than benzene toward electrophilic aromatic substitution. The ortho and para positions are most deactivated by resonance, making the meta position relatively more reactive (though still less reactive than benzene). Other meta directors include -CN, -COOH, -SO₃H, -COR, and -CHO. In contrast, -CH₃ and -OH are ortho/para directors and activating, while -Cl is an ortho/para director but weakly deactivating."
