  Order of activation: -O⁻ > -NH₂ > -OH > -OR > -NHCOCH₃ > -CH₃ > -H (benzene) > halogens
  > deactivating groups. Among the options, -OH is the most activating due to strong
  +M effect.

  question: Which of the following is the MOST activating group?
  options:
  - -CH₃
  - -OH
  - -Cl
  - -COOH
  correct_answer: -OH
  explanation: "Among the given options, -OH (hydroxyl) is the most activating group. The general order of activation is: -O⁻ > -NH₂ > -OH > -OR > -NHCOCH₃ > -CH₃ > benzene > halogens > deactivating groups. The -OH group is strongly activating due to its powerful +M (mesomeric/resonance) effect - the oxygen lone pairs donate electron density into the benzene ring through resonance, making it highly nucleophilic toward electrophiles. While -OH has a -I (inductive) effect due to oxygen's electronegativity, the +M effect dominates. Comparing the options: -CH₃ is weakly activating (+I only), -Cl is weakly deactivating (+M < -I), and -COOH is strongly deactivating (-M and -I). Phenol is 1000× more reactive than benzene in EAS reactions."
