  alkyl groups? 🚀


  Friedel-Crafts acylation is preferred because: (1) Acylium ion is resonance stabilized
  (no rearrangement) (2) Ketone product is deactivated (no polyacylation). The ketone
  can then be reduced to give the alkyl group.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

    alkyl groups?
  options:
  - Acylation is faster
  - Acylation has no polysubstitution or rearrangement problems
  - Acylation requires milder conditions
  - Acylation gives higher yields
  correct_answer: Acylation has no polysubstitution or rearrangement problems
  explanation: "Friedel-Crafts acylation is preferred over alkylation for introducing alkyl groups because acylation avoids two major problems: (1) No carbocation rearrangement - the acylium ion (RC=O⁺) is resonance-stabilized and doesn't rearrange, unlike alkyl carbocations. (2) No polysubstitution - the ketone product is deactivated (electron-withdrawing C=O group), preventing further acylation. In contrast, alkylation products are more activated than benzene, leading to polyalkylation. After acylation, the ketone can be reduced (Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction) to give the desired alkyl group without rearrangement."
