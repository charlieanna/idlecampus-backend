  Nitrobenzene has -NO₂ group which is a strong meta director. Bromination gives m-bromonitrobenzene
  as the major product. The reaction is also very slow because -NO₂ is strongly deactivating.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: When nitrobenzene undergoes bromination, what is the major product?
  options:
  - o-Bromonitrobenzene
  - m-Bromonitrobenzene
  - p-Bromonitrobenzene
  - Mixture of o- and p-bromonitrobenzene
  correct_answer: m-Bromonitrobenzene
  explanation: "When nitrobenzene undergoes bromination, m-bromonitrobenzene (meta-bromonitrobenzene) is the major product. The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strong meta director because it withdraws electron density from ortho and para positions through resonance (-M effect) and induction (-I effect), making these positions highly deactivated. The meta position, though still deactivated, is relatively more reactive than ortho/para. The reaction is also very slow and requires harsh conditions (elevated temperature, Lewis acid catalyst) because -NO₂ is a strong deactivating group that makes the entire ring electron-poor and less nucleophilic toward electrophiles."
