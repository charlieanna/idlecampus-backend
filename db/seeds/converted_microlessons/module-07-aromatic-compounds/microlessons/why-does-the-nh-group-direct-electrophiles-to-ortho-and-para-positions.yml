  -NH₂ has a lone pair that can donate into the ring (+M effect). At o/p positions,
  resonance structures place positive charge on N, which stabilizes the σ-complex.
  This is not possible for meta attack.


  ## Key Points

  question: Why does the -NH₂ group direct electrophiles to ortho and para positions?
  options:
  - It withdraws electrons from these positions
  - It stabilizes the σ-complex at o/p positions through resonance
  - It is sterically hindered at meta position
  - It has strong -I effect
  correct_answer: It stabilizes the σ-complex at o/p positions through resonance
  explanation: "The -NH₂ (amino) group directs electrophiles to ortho and para positions because it stabilizes the σ-complex (arenium ion) intermediate through resonance at these positions. The nitrogen's lone pair can donate electron density into the ring (+M effect, mesomeric effect). When electrophilic attack occurs at ortho or para positions, resonance structures can be drawn where the positive charge is on the nitrogen atom - this is highly stabilized because nitrogen can accommodate the positive charge (like in ammonium ions). For meta attack, no such resonance structure is possible, making it less favorable. This powerful +M effect makes -NH₂ one of the strongest activating groups and ortho/para directors in electrophilic aromatic substitution."
