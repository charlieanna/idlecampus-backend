  what is the major product? 🚀


  The n-propyl carbocation (1°) rearranges to the more stable isopropyl carbocation
  (2°) via hydride shift. Therefore, isopropylbenzene is the major product, not n-propylbenzene.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: When n-propyl chloride reacts with benzene in the presence of AlCl₃, what
    is the major product?
  options:
  - n-Propylbenzene
  - Isopropylbenzene
  - Benzyl chloride
  - Cyclopropylbenzene
  correct_answer: Isopropylbenzene
  explanation: "When n-propyl chloride reacts with benzene in the presence of AlCl₃ (a Friedel-Crafts alkylation), the n-propyl carbocation (primary, 1°) that initially forms is unstable and undergoes a hydride shift rearrangement to form the more stable isopropyl carbocation (secondary, 2°). This rearranged carbocation then attacks benzene to give isopropylbenzene (cumene) as the major product, not n-propylbenzene. Carbocation rearrangements are a common limitation of Friedel-Crafts alkylation, where primary carbocations readily rearrange to more stable secondary or tertiary carbocations."
