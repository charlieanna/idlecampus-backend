  Aromatic compounds have (4n+2) π electrons where n=0,1,2,3... → 2,6,10,14,18...
  For n=1: 4(1)+2=6. The values 4, 8, 12 are 4n (antiaromatic).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.

  correct_answer: '6'
  explanation: "According to Hückel's rule, aromatic compounds must have (4n+2) π electrons, where n is a non-negative integer (n = 0, 1, 2, 3...). For n=1, this gives 4(1)+2 = 6 π electrons, which is the number in benzene. Other aromatic numbers include 2 (n=0, found in cyclopropenyl cation), 10 (n=2, naphthalene), 14 (n=3, anthracene), and 18 (n=4, [18]annulene). The values 4, 8, and 12 follow the 4n rule and correspond to antiaromatic compounds, which are especially unstable. Benzene's 6 π electrons (three π bonds) in a cyclic, planar, conjugated system make it aromatic with exceptional stability."
