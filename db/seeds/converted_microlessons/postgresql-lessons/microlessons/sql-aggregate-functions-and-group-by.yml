  \ Functions and GROUP BY\n\n      Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple\
  \ rows of data and return a single value. They are essential for data analysis and\
  \ reporting.\n\n      ## Common Aggregate Functions\n\n      ### COUNT()\n     \
  \ Counts the number of rows:\n      ```sql\n      SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;\n\
  \      SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT city) FROM users;\n      ```\n\n      ### SUM()\n \
  \     Adds up numeric values:\n      ```sql\n      SELECT SUM(price) FROM orders;\n\
  \      ```\n\n      ### AVG()\n      Calculates the average:\n      ```sql\n   \
  \   SELECT AVG(age) FROM users;\n      ```\n\n      ### MAX() and MIN()\n      Find\
  \ maximum and minimum values:\n      ```sql\n      SELECT MAX(price), MIN(price)\
  \ FROM products;\n      ```\n\n      ## GROUP BY Clause\n\n      GROUP BY groups\
  \ rows with the same values into summary rows:\n\n      ```sql\n      SELECT city,\
  \ COUNT(*) as user_count\n      FROM users\n      GROUP BY city;\n      ```\n\n\
  \      ## HAVING Clause\n\n      HAVING filters grouped results (like WHERE for\
  \ aggregates):\n\n      ```sql\n      SELECT city, COUNT(*) as user_count\n    \
  \  FROM users\n      GROUP BY city\n      HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;\n      ```\n\n  \
  \    ## Examples\n\n      **Count users by city:**\n      ```sql\n      SELECT city,\
  \ COUNT(*) FROM users\n      GROUP BY city;\n      ```\n\n      **Average age by\
  \ city:**\n      ```sql\n      SELECT city, AVG(age) as avg_age\n      FROM users\n\
  \      GROUP BY city;\n      ```\n\n      **Cities with more than 3 users:**\n \
  \     ```sql\n      SELECT city, COUNT(*) as count\n      FROM users\n      GROUP\
  \ BY city\n      HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;\n      ```\n\n      Ready to practice aggregate\
  \ functions? Let's move to the lab!\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Aggregate functions\n\n\
  - GROUP BY\n\n- HAVING clause"
