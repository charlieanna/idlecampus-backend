  \ to SQL SELECT Statements\n\n      SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard\
  \ language for interacting with relational databases. The most fundamental SQL operation\
  \ is the **SELECT** statement, which allows you to retrieve data from database tables.\n\
  \n      ## Basic SELECT Syntax\n\n      The simplest form of a SELECT statement\
  \ is:\n\n      ```sql\n      SELECT column1, column2, ...\n      FROM table_name;\n\
  \      ```\n\n      To select all columns from a table:\n\n      ```sql\n      SELECT\
  \ * FROM table_name;\n      ```\n\n      ## The WHERE Clause\n\n      The WHERE\
  \ clause is used to filter records based on specific conditions:\n\n      ```sql\n\
  \      SELECT * FROM users\n      WHERE age > 25;\n      ```\n\n      ### Common\
  \ WHERE Operators\n\n      - `=` : Equal to\n      - `>` : Greater than\n      -\
  \ `<` : Less than\n      - `>=` : Greater than or equal to\n      - `<=` : Less\
  \ than or equal to\n      - `!=` or `<>` : Not equal to\n      - `LIKE` : Pattern\
  \ matching\n      - `IN` : Match any value in a list\n      - `BETWEEN` : Within\
  \ a range\n\n      ## Examples\n\n      **Select specific columns:**\n      ```sql\n\
  \      SELECT name, email FROM users;\n      ```\n\n      **Filter by condition:**\n\
  \      ```sql\n      SELECT name, city FROM users\n      WHERE city = 'New York';\n\
  \      ```\n\n      **Multiple conditions:**\n      ```sql\n      SELECT * FROM\
  \ users\n      WHERE age > 30 AND city = 'Boston';\n      ```\n\n      ## Practice\
  \ Time!\n\n      Now you're ready to practice SELECT statements with the hands-on\
  \ lab. You'll work with a real users table and write queries to retrieve specific\
  \ data.\n\n## Key Points\n\n- SELECT statement\n\n- WHERE clause\n\n- Filtering\
  \ data"
