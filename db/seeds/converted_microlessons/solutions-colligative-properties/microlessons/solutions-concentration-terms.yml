  \ Terms\n\n    ## Solutions\n\n    **Solution** = Homogeneous mixture of two or\
  \ more substances\n\n    ### Components:\n    - **Solute:** Substance present in\
  \ smaller amount (gets dissolved)\n    - **Solvent:** Substance present in larger\
  \ amount (does the dissolving)\n\n    ### Types Based on Physical State:\n\n   \
  \ | Solute | Solvent | Example |\n    |--------|---------|---------|\n    | Gas\

  \n    ## Concentration Terms\n\n    ### 1. Molarity (M)\n\n    **Definition:** Number\
  \ of moles of solute per liter of solution\n\n    **M = n/V = w/(M × V)**\n\n  \
  \  Where:\n    - n = moles of solute\n    - w = mass of solute (g)\n    - M = molar\
  \ mass (g/mol)\n    - V = volume of solution (L)\n\n    **Units:** mol/L or M\n\n\

  \   - Molar mass H₂SO₄ = 98 g/mol\n    - n = 49/98 = 0.5 mol\n    - V = 0.5 L\n\
  \    - M = 0.5/0.5 = **1 M**\n\n    ### 2. Molality (m)\n\n    **Definition:** Number\

  \ molar mass (g/mol)\n    - W = mass of solvent (kg)\n\n    **Units:** mol/kg or\
  \ m\n\n    **Temperature independent** (mass doesn't change)\n\n    ### Example:\n\
  \    5.85 g NaCl dissolved in 100 g water. Find molality.\n\n    - Molar mass NaCl\
  \ = 58.5 g/mol\n    - n = 5.85/58.5 = 0.1 mol\n    - W = 0.1 kg\n    - m = 0.1/0.1\

  \    - nₐ = moles of component A\n    - nᵦ = moles of component B\n\n    **Properties:**\n\
  \    - Xₐ + Xᵦ = 1 (for binary solution)\n    - Dimensionless (no units)\n    -\
  \ Temperature independent\n\n    ### Example:\n    Solution contains 1 mol ethanol\
  \ and 4 mol water. Find mole fractions.\n\n    - Total moles = 1 + 4 = 5\n    -\
  \ X_ethanol = 1/5 = **0.2**\n    - X_water = 4/5 = **0.8**\n\n    ### 4. Mass Percentage\
  \ (% w/w)\n\n    **% w/w = (Mass of solute / Mass of solution) × 100**\n\n    ###\
  \ Example:\n    10 g sugar dissolved in 90 g water.\n\n    - Total mass = 100 g\n\
  \    - % w/w = (10/100) × 100 = **10%**\n\n    ### 5. Volume Percentage (% v/v)\n\
  \n    **% v/v = (Volume of solute / Volume of solution) × 100**\n\n    Used for\
  \ liquid-liquid solutions\n\n    ### 6. Mass by Volume (% w/v)\n\n    **% w/v =\
  \ (Mass of solute in g / Volume of solution in mL) × 100**\n\n    ### 7. Parts Per\
  \ Million (ppm)\n\n    **ppm = (Mass of solute / Mass of solution) × 10⁶**\n\n \
  \   Used for very dilute solutions\n\n    ### 8. Normality (N)\n\n    **N = Number\
  \ of gram equivalents / Volume (L)**\n\n    **Gram equivalent = Mass / Equivalent\
  \ weight**\n\n    **For acids:** Eq. wt. = Molar mass / Basicity\n    **For bases:**\
  \ Eq. wt. = Molar mass / Acidity\n\n    ## Relationships Between Concentration Terms\n\
  \n    ### Molarity to Molality:\n\n    **m = (1000 × M) / (1000d - M × M₂)**\n\n\
  \    Where:\n    - d = density of solution (g/mL)\n    - M = molarity\n    - M₂\
  \ = molar mass of solute\n\n    ### Molality to Mole Fraction:\n\n    **Xsolute\
  \ = (m × Msolvent) / (1000 + m × Msolvent)**\n\n    **Xsolvent = 1000 / (1000 +\
  \ m × Msolute)**\n\n    ### Mole Fraction to Molality:\n\n    **m = (1000 × X₂)\
  \ / (M₁ × X₁)**\n\n    Where:\n    - X₂ = mole fraction of solute\n    - X₁ = mole\

  \    **Solubility:** Maximum amount of solute that dissolves in given amount of\
  \ solvent at specific temperature\n\n    ### Factors Affecting Solubility:\n\n \
  \   **1. Nature of solute and solvent:**\n    - \"Like dissolves like\"\n    - Polar\
  \ solutes dissolve in polar solvents\n    - Non-polar solutes dissolve in non-polar\
  \ solvents\n\n    **2. Temperature:**\n    - For most solids: Solubility ↑ with\
  \ temperature ↑\n    - For gases: Solubility ↓ with temperature ↑\n\n    **3. Pressure\
  \ (for gases):**\n    - Henry's Law: **P = KH × X**\n    - Higher pressure → higher\
  \ solubility\n\n    ## Henry's Law\n\n    **Statement:** At constant temperature,\
  \ solubility of gas is directly proportional to partial pressure\n\n    **P = KH\
  \ × X**\n\n    Or: **X = P/KH**\n\n    Where:\n    - P = partial pressure of gas\n\
  \    - KH = Henry's law constant\n    - X = mole fraction of gas in solution\n\n\
  \    **Higher KH** → Lower solubility (less favorable dissolution)\n\n    ### Applications:\n\

  question: What is the fundamental difference between molarity and molality, and
    why is molality preferred for colligative properties?
  options:
  - Molarity measures concentration more accurately than molality
  - Molarity (mol/L) is temperature-dependent because volume changes with temperature;
    molality (mol/kg) is temperature-independent because mass is constant, making
    it ideal for colligative properties studied across temperature ranges
  - Molality is easier to calculate in the laboratory
  - Molarity works for all solvents; molality works only for water
  correct_answer: Molarity (mol/L) is temperature-dependent because volume changes
    with temperature; molality (mol/kg) is temperature-independent because mass is
    constant, making it ideal for colligative properties studied across temperature
    ranges
  explanation: 'Molarity and molality differ in the denominator of their definitions.
    MOLARITY (M) = moles of solute / volume of solution (L). Since liquids expand
    with increasing temperature and contract with decreasing temperature, the volume
    of a solution changes with temperature. Thus, a 1 M solution at 25°C might be
    0.98 M at 50°C (volume expanded) or 1.02 M at 0°C (volume contracted). This temperature
    dependence makes molarity inconvenient for precise thermodynamic calculations.
    MOLALITY (m) = moles of solute / mass of solvent (kg). Mass does not change with
    temperature - 1 kg of water is 1 kg at all temperatures. Therefore, molality is
    temperature-independent, providing a constant concentration measure across temperature
    ranges. COLLIGATIVE PROPERTIES (vapor pressure lowering, boiling point elevation
    ΔTb = Kb·m, freezing point depression ΔTf = Kf·m, osmotic pressure) depend only
    on the number of solute particles, not their identity. These properties are studied
    across varying temperatures (e.g., freezing point depression requires measuring
    at different temperatures). Using molality ensures the concentration term remains
    constant, allowing accurate comparison. Formula: If you know molarity M, density
    d (g/mL), and molar mass of solute M₂, convert to molality: m = (1000 × M) / (1000d
    - M × M₂). For dilute aqueous solutions, molarity ≈ molality (since water density
    ≈ 1 g/mL), but for precise work or concentrated solutions, use molality. Remember:
    Molality for colligative properties, molarity for volumetric work like titrations.'

  question: Henry's Law states P = KH × X. What does this relationship mean, and why
    does gas solubility decrease with increasing temperature despite the law being
    stated for constant temperature?
  options:
  - Higher pressure increases solubility; temperature has no effect on gas solubility
  - At constant T, gas solubility (X) is proportional to partial pressure (P) with
    constant KH; as temperature increases, KH increases, reducing solubility even
    at the same pressure
  - Henry's Law only applies to ideal gases at standard pressure
  - Temperature increase makes gases more soluble in all cases
  correct_answer: At constant T, gas solubility (X) is proportional to partial pressure
    (P) with constant KH; as temperature increases, KH increases, reducing solubility
    even at the same pressure
  explanation: 'Henry''s Law: P = KH × X (or X = P/KH) states that at constant temperature,
    the mole fraction (X) of a dissolved gas in solution is directly proportional
    to its partial pressure (P) above the solution. KH is Henry''s law constant, specific
    to each gas-solvent pair. INTERPRETATION: Higher partial pressure → more gas dissolves.
    For example, carbonated beverages are bottled under high CO₂ pressure (~4 atm),
    increasing CO₂ solubility. When you open the bottle (pressure drops to 1 atm),
    X decreases and CO₂ escapes (fizzing). PRESSURE EFFECT: Increasing pressure physically
    forces more gas molecules into solution, increasing X proportionally. This is
    why scuba divers at depth (high pressure) dissolve more N₂ in blood, risking decompression
    sickness if they ascend too quickly. TEMPERATURE EFFECT: The law is stated "at
    constant temperature" because KH itself depends strongly on temperature. For gases,
    dissolution is generally exothermic (releases heat), so by Le Chatelier''s principle,
    increasing temperature disfavors dissolution (shifts equilibrium toward gas phase).
    Mathematically, as T increases, KH increases. Since X = P/KH, for constant P,
    higher KH means lower X - less gas dissolves. Example: Cold soda retains CO₂ better
    than warm soda. Fish in warm water suffer from low dissolved O₂. APPLICATIONS:
    (1) Carbonated drinks - high P, low T for maximum CO₂, (2) Scuba diving - high
    pressure underwater increases N₂ dissolution, (3) Aquariums - need cool water
    or aeration for sufficient O₂. Note: Higher KH indicates LOWER solubility (inverse
    relationship in X = P/KH).'

  question: A 2 M NaCl solution has density 1.08 g/mL. Calculate the molality and
    explain the conversion process.
  options:
  - Molality equals molarity, so 2 m
  - 'Molality ≈ 2.08 m. For 1 L solution: mass = 1080 g, NaCl mass = 117 g (2 mol
    × 58.5 g/mol), solvent mass = 963 g = 0.963 kg, m = 2 mol / 0.963 kg ≈ 2.08 m'
  - Cannot convert between molarity and molality without knowing temperature
  - Molality = 2 M / 1.08 = 1.85 m
  correct_answer: 'Molality ≈ 2.08 m. For 1 L solution: mass = 1080 g, NaCl mass =
    117 g (2 mol × 58.5 g/mol), solvent mass = 963 g = 0.963 kg, m = 2 mol / 0.963
    kg ≈ 2.08 m'
  explanation: 'Converting molarity to molality requires knowing the solution density.
    STRATEGY: Consider a convenient volume (1 L = 1000 mL) and work from there. STEP
    1: Calculate mass of 1 L solution using density. Mass = volume × density = 1000
    mL × 1.08 g/mL = 1080 g. This is the total solution mass (solute + solvent). STEP
    2: Calculate moles and mass of solute. Molarity = 2 M means 2 moles NaCl in 1
    L solution. Molar mass NaCl = 23 + 35.5 = 58.5 g/mol. Mass of NaCl = 2 mol × 58.5
    g/mol = 117 g. STEP 3: Calculate mass of solvent. Mass of solution = mass of solute
    + mass of solvent. 1080 g = 117 g + mass of water. Mass of water = 1080 - 117
    = 963 g = 0.963 kg. STEP 4: Calculate molality. Molality = moles of solute / kg
    of solvent = 2 mol / 0.963 kg = 2.077 m ≈ 2.08 m. GENERAL FORMULA: m = (1000 ×
    M) / (1000d - M × M₂), where M = molarity, d = density (g/mL), M₂ = molar mass
    of solute. Substituting: m = (1000 × 2) / (1000 × 1.08 - 2 × 58.5) = 2000 / (1080
    - 117) = 2000/963 = 2.08 m. OBSERVATIONS: (1) Molality > molarity here because
    the solution density > 1 g/mL (dissolved salt increases density beyond water''s
    1.0 g/mL), (2) For dilute aqueous solutions (d ≈ 1.0 g/mL), molarity ≈ molality,
    (3) This conversion is essential when you need molality for colligative property
    calculations but laboratory data gives molarity.'
