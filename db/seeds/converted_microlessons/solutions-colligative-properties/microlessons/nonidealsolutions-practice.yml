  Ethanol + Water shows positive deviation (A-B interactions weaker than A-A and B-B)
  forming minimum boiling azeotrope.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: 'Ethanol + Water solution shows:'
  options:
  - Ideal behavior
  - Positive deviation
  - Negative deviation
  - No deviation
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Positive deviation
  explanation: 'Ethanol + Water mixture shows positive deviation from Raoult''s law.
    This occurs because ethanol-water (A-B) interactions are weaker than the average
    of ethanol-ethanol (A-A) and water-water (B-B) interactions. Pure water has strong
    H-bonding, and adding ethanol disrupts these H-bonds without forming equally strong
    ethanol-water H-bonds. As a result, molecules escape more easily, vapor pressure
    increases above ideal, and the mixture forms a minimum boiling azeotrope (boiling
    at 78.2°C, lower than water''s 100°C). This is practically important: you cannot
    completely separate ethanol-water by simple distillation beyond the azeotropic
    composition (95.6% ethanol).'

  question: 'Solutions showing negative deviation have:'
  options:
  - Vapor pressure lower than predicted by Raoult's law and ΔH_mixing < 0
  - Vapor pressure higher than predicted by Raoult's law
  - ΔH_mixing > 0
  - No change in properties
  correct_answer: Vapor pressure lower than predicted by Raoult's law and ΔH_mixing < 0
  explanation: "Negative deviation occurs when A-B interactions are stronger than the average of A-A and B-B interactions. This causes: (1) Lower vapor pressure than ideal (molecules held more tightly), (2) ΔH_mixing < 0 (exothermic mixing - heat released), (3) ΔV_mixing < 0 (volume contraction), (4) Formation of maximum boiling azeotrope. Examples: HCl + water, HNO₃ + water, chloroform + acetone. The strong interactions make it harder for molecules to escape into vapor phase."

  question: 'An azeotropic mixture is one that:'
  options:
  - Has constant boiling point and composition in both liquid and vapor phases
  - Can be completely separated by distillation
  - Shows ideal behavior
  - Has no vapor pressure
  correct_answer: Has constant boiling point and composition in both liquid and vapor phases
  explanation: "An azeotrope (constant boiling mixture) has the same composition in both liquid and vapor phases, so it distills unchanged. Minimum boiling azeotropes (like ethanol-water at 95.6% ethanol, 78.2°C) show positive deviation. Maximum boiling azeotropes (like HCl-water at 20.2% HCl, 108.6°C) show negative deviation. Azeotropes cannot be separated by simple distillation - special methods like azeotropic distillation or using drying agents are needed."
