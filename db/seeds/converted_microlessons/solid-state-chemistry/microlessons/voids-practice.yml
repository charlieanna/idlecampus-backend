  Number of tetrahedral voids = 2n, where n = number of atoms. Here n = 4, so tetrahedral
  voids = 2×4 = 8.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: If a close-packed structure has 4 atoms, how many tetrahedral voids are present?
  options:
  - '2'
  - '4'
  - '8'
  - '16'
  correct_answer: '8'
  explanation: "The number of tetrahedral voids = 2n, where n = number of atoms in the packing. Here n = 4, so tetrahedral voids = 2 × 4 = 8. Tetrahedral voids are formed when a sphere is placed in the hollow created by three spheres."

  question: How many octahedral voids are present per atom in a close-packed structure?
  options:
  - 1 octahedral void per atom
  - 2 octahedral voids per atom
  - 0.5 octahedral voids per atom
  - 4 octahedral voids per atom
  correct_answer: 1 octahedral void per atom
  explanation: "In a close-packed structure, the number of octahedral voids equals the number of atoms (n). So there is 1 octahedral void per atom. Octahedral voids are formed when a sphere is placed in the hollow created by six spheres arranged octahedrally."

  question: Which void is larger in a close-packed structure?
  options:
  - Tetrahedral void
  - Octahedral void
  - Both are equal
  - Depends on the atom size
  correct_answer: Octahedral void
  explanation: "Octahedral voids are larger than tetrahedral voids in a close-packed structure. The radius ratio for octahedral voids is 0.414, while for tetrahedral voids it is 0.225. This means larger cations can occupy octahedral voids."
