  P (Group 15) has 5 valence electrons. When doped in Si (Group 14), it provides extra
  electron, creating n-type semiconductor.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'Silicon doped with phosphorus gives:'
  options:
  - n-type semiconductor
  - p-type semiconductor
  - Insulator
  - Conductor
  correct_answer: n-type semiconductor
  explanation: "When silicon (Group 14, 4 valence electrons) is doped with phosphorus (Group 15, 5 valence electrons), the extra electron from phosphorus creates an n-type (negative-type) semiconductor. The '5th' electron becomes a charge carrier, increasing conductivity. P (Group 15) has 5 valence electrons, providing an extra electron donor."

  question: 'Silicon doped with boron gives:'
  options:
  - p-type semiconductor
  - n-type semiconductor
  - Insulator
  - Conductor
  correct_answer: p-type semiconductor
  explanation: "When silicon (Group 14, 4 valence electrons) is doped with boron (Group 13, 3 valence electrons), it creates electron 'holes' (positive charge carriers), producing a p-type (positive-type) semiconductor. Boron acts as an electron acceptor, creating vacancies in the valence band."

  question: Which element can be used to make n-type semiconductor from germanium?
  options:
  - Arsenic
  - Boron
  - Aluminum
  - Gallium
  correct_answer: Arsenic
  explanation: "Arsenic (Group 15, 5 valence electrons) can be used to dope germanium (Group 14, 4 valence electrons) to create an n-type semiconductor. The extra electron from arsenic acts as a charge carrier. Boron, aluminum, and gallium are Group 13 elements that would create p-type semiconductors."
