  question: What is the maximum packing efficiency in a crystal structure?
  options:
  - 52%
  - 68%
  - 74%
  - 100%
  correct_answer: 74%
  explanation: "The maximum packing efficiency in crystal structures is 74%, achieved by FCC (face-centered cubic) and HCP (hexagonal close packing) structures. These are called closest packing arrangements. BCC has 68% and simple cubic has 52% packing efficiency."

  question: What is the packing efficiency of BCC structure?
  options:
  - 52%
  - 68%
  - 74%
  - 90%
  correct_answer: 68%
  explanation: "Body-centered cubic (BCC) structure has a packing efficiency of 68%. This is intermediate between simple cubic (52%) and the closest packing structures FCC/HCP (74%). The packing efficiency represents the percentage of space occupied by atoms in the unit cell."

  question: Which structures have the same packing efficiency?
  options:
  - FCC and HCP
  - BCC and FCC
  - Simple cubic and BCC
  - HCP and BCC
  correct_answer: FCC and HCP
  explanation: "FCC (face-centered cubic) and HCP (hexagonal close packing) both have the same maximum packing efficiency of 74%. They are both closest packing arrangements, differing only in the stacking sequence: ABCABC for FCC and ABAB for HCP."
