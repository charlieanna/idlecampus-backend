  In BCC, each atom at corner is surrounded by 8 nearest neighbors (one at center
  + 7 at other corners diagonally). CN = 8.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the coordination number in BCC structure?
  options:
  - '6'
  - '8'
  - '12'
  - '4'
  correct_answer: '8'
  explanation: "In body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, each atom at the corner is surrounded by 8 nearest neighbors - one at the body center and 7 other corner atoms located diagonally. Therefore, the coordination number is 8. This is different from FCC (12) and simple cubic (6)."

  question: What is the coordination number in FCC (face-centered cubic) structure?
  options:
  - '8'
  - '12'
  - '6'
  - '4'
  correct_answer: '12'
  explanation: "In FCC structure, each atom is surrounded by 12 nearest neighbors - 4 in the same layer, 4 in the layer above, and 4 in the layer below. This gives the maximum coordination number among cubic structures and is also characteristic of closest packing."

  question: Which structure has a coordination number of 6?
  options:
  - Simple cubic
  - BCC
  - FCC
  - Hexagonal
  correct_answer: Simple cubic
  explanation: "Simple cubic structure has a coordination number of 6, where each atom is surrounded by 6 nearest neighbors (one on each face). This is the lowest coordination number among the three cubic structures: simple cubic (6), BCC (8), and FCC (12)."
