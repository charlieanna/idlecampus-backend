  Zn²⁺ has 3d¹⁰ configuration (all paired electrons), hence diamagnetic. Others have
  unpaired electrons (paramagnetic).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which ion is diamagnetic?
  options:
  - Cu²⁺
  - Fe³⁺
  - Zn²⁺
  - Ni²⁺
  correct_answer: Zn²⁺
  explanation: "Zn²⁺ is diamagnetic because it has a completely filled 3d¹⁰ configuration with all electrons paired. Diamagnetic substances have no unpaired electrons and are weakly repelled by magnetic fields. Cu²⁺ (3d⁹), Fe³⁺ (3d⁵), and Ni²⁺ (3d⁸) all have unpaired electrons and are therefore paramagnetic."

  question: A paramagnetic substance is
  options:
  - weakly attracted by magnetic field
  - weakly repelled by magnetic field
  - strongly attracted and permanently magnetized
  - not affected by magnetic field
  correct_answer: weakly attracted by magnetic field
  explanation: "Paramagnetic substances are weakly attracted by magnetic fields due to the presence of unpaired electrons. They do not retain magnetization when the external field is removed. Examples include Cu²⁺, Fe³⁺, and O₂. This is different from diamagnetic (weakly repelled) and ferromagnetic (strongly attracted and permanently magnetized) substances."

  question: Which of the following is diamagnetic?
  options:
  - O₂
  - Cu²⁺
  - H₂O
  - Fe³⁺
  correct_answer: H₂O
  explanation: "H₂O is diamagnetic because all its electrons are paired. It has no unpaired electrons in its molecular orbitals. O₂ is paramagnetic (has two unpaired electrons in π* orbitals), while Cu²⁺ and Fe³⁺ have unpaired d-electrons making them paramagnetic."
