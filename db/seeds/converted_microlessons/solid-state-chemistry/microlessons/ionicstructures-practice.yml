  question: What is the coordination number in NaCl (rock salt) structure?
  options:
  - 4:4
  - 6:6
  - 8:8
  - 12:12
  correct_answer: 6:6
  explanation: "NaCl has rock salt structure where each Na⁺ is surrounded by 6 Cl⁻ ions and each Cl⁻ is surrounded by 6 Na⁺ ions. The coordination number is thus 6:6. This is one of the most common ionic structures."

  question: Which ionic compound has a 4:4 coordination structure?
  options:
  - NaCl
  - ZnS (zinc blende)
  - CsCl
  - CaF₂
  correct_answer: ZnS (zinc blende)
  explanation: "ZnS in zinc blende structure has 4:4 coordination, where each Zn²⁺ is tetrahedrally surrounded by 4 S²⁻ ions and vice versa. NaCl has 6:6, CsCl has 8:8, and CaF₂ (fluorite) has 8:4 coordination."

  question: CsCl has which type of structure?
  options:
  - Rock salt (6:6)
  - Body-centered cubic type (8:8)
  - Zinc blende (4:4)
  - Fluorite (8:4)
  correct_answer: Body-centered cubic type (8:8)
  explanation: "CsCl has a body-centered cubic type structure with 8:8 coordination. Each Cs⁺ is surrounded by 8 Cl⁻ ions at the corners of a cube, and each Cl⁻ is surrounded by 8 Cs⁺ ions. This structure is possible due to the large size of Cs⁺ ion."
