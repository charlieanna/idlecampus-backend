  Schottky defect involves missing ions from lattice, which decreases mass while volume
  remains same, hence density decreases. Frenkel involves displacement, not removal.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which defect decreases the density of a crystal?
  options:
  - Schottky defect
  - Frenkel defect
  - Interstitial defect
  - F-center
  correct_answer: Schottky defect
  explanation: "Schottky defect decreases the density of a crystal because it involves the complete removal of cation-anion pairs from the crystal lattice, leaving vacancies. This decreases the mass while the volume remains essentially the same, thus reducing density (ρ = m/V). In contrast, Frenkel defect involves displacement of ions to interstitial sites without removal, so mass and volume remain constant, keeping density unchanged."

  question: Frenkel defect is shown by
  options:
  - AgBr
  - NaCl
  - KCl
  - CsCl
  correct_answer: AgBr
  explanation: "Frenkel defect is shown by AgBr, AgCl, and ZnS. This defect occurs when a small cation is displaced from its lattice site to an interstitial site. It requires a large difference in size between cation and anion, and small cations that can fit into interstitial sites. AgBr satisfies these conditions with small Ag⁺ ions."

  question: What is an F-center in a crystal?
  options:
  - Anionic vacancy with trapped electron
  - Cationic vacancy with trapped hole
  - Displaced cation in interstitial site
  - Missing cation-anion pair
  correct_answer: Anionic vacancy with trapped electron
  explanation: "An F-center (from German 'Farbzentrum' meaning color center) is an anionic vacancy that has trapped an electron. This defect imparts color to crystals. For example, NaCl crystals with F-centers appear yellow, and KCl appears violet. The trapped electron can absorb visible light, causing the coloration."
