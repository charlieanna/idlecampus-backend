  FCC has atoms at 8 corners (8×1/8 = 1) and 6 face centers (6×1/2 = 3). Total = 4
  atoms.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.

  question: How many atoms are present in one FCC unit cell?
  options:
  - '1'
  - '2'
  - '4'
  - '6'
  correct_answer: '4'
  explanation: "FCC (face-centered cubic) has atoms at 8 corners (8 × 1/8 = 1 atom) and 6 face centers (6 × 1/2 = 3 atoms). Total = 1 + 3 = 4 atoms per unit cell. Each corner atom is shared by 8 unit cells and each face-centered atom is shared by 2 unit cells."

  question: How many atoms are present in one BCC unit cell?
  options:
  - '1'
  - '2'
  - '4'
  - '8'
  correct_answer: '2'
  explanation: "BCC (body-centered cubic) has atoms at 8 corners (8 × 1/8 = 1 atom) and 1 atom at the body center (1 × 1 = 1 atom). Total = 1 + 1 = 2 atoms per unit cell. The body-centered atom is not shared with any other unit cell."

  question: A simple cubic unit cell contains how many atoms?
  options:
  - '1'
  - '2'
  - '4'
  - '8'
  correct_answer: '1'
  explanation: "A simple cubic unit cell has atoms only at the 8 corners. Each corner atom is shared by 8 unit cells, so contribution per unit cell = 8 × 1/8 = 1 atom. This is the simplest cubic structure with the lowest packing efficiency."
