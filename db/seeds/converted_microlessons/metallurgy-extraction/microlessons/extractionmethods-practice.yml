  Highly reactive metals (Al, Na, K, Ca, Mg) have very stable oxides and require electrolytic
  reduction. Fe is extracted by carbon reduction, Cu by self-reduction.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which metals are extracted by electrolytic reduction?
  options:
  - Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al
  - Fe, Zn, Pb, Cu
  - Ag, Au, Pt
  - Hg, Sn, Ni
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al
  explanation: 'Metal extraction methods depend on reactivity (position in reactivity
    series): **ELECTROLYTIC REDUCTION** (for highly reactive metals): Na, K, Ca,
    Mg, Al - These have very stable oxides that cannot be reduced by carbon or CO.
    They require electrolysis of molten salts (e.g., Al from Al₂O₃, Na from NaCl).
    **CARBON/CO REDUCTION** (for moderately reactive metals): Fe, Zn, Pb, Sn - Extracted
    by heating their oxides with carbon/coke in furnaces (e.g., Fe from Fe₂O₃ in
    blast furnace). **SELF-REDUCTION** (for less reactive metals): Cu, Hg - Cu₂S
    partially oxidizes to Cu₂O, which then reacts with remaining Cu₂S (self-reduction).
    **OCCUR FREE** (for noble/least reactive metals): Ag, Au, Pt - Found naturally
    in metallic state, need only physical separation. Reactivity series: K > Na >
    Ca > Mg > Al > Zn > Fe > Pb > Cu > Hg > Ag > Au. General rule: Higher reactivity
    = more energy needed for extraction = more expensive.'

  question: Why cannot aluminum be extracted by carbon reduction?
  options:
  - Carbon is more expensive than electricity
  - Aluminum oxide is too stable and carbon cannot reduce it
  - Aluminum reacts with carbon forming carbides
  - Carbon reduction produces impure aluminum
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Aluminum oxide is too stable and carbon cannot reduce it
  explanation: 'Aluminum cannot be extracted by carbon reduction because: **Al₂O₃
    is extremely stable** - Aluminum has very high affinity for oxygen. In Ellingham
    diagram, the Al₂O₃ line lies **below** the C→CO line at all temperatures, meaning
    the reaction Al₂O₃ + C → Al + CO is **thermodynamically unfavorable** (positive
    ΔG). Carbon simply cannot "steal" oxygen from Al₂O₃. Additionally: (1) Even if
    attempted, Al forms carbides (Al₄C₃) with carbon, contaminating the product.
    (2) Very high temperatures (~2000°C+) would be needed, making it impractical.
    **Solution: Hall-Heroult process** - Electrolysis of molten Al₂O₃ dissolved in
    cryolite at ~950°C. Electrical energy (not chemical reducing agent) breaks the
    strong Al-O bonds. This is why aluminum was once more precious than gold (before
    1886)! Historical: Napoleon III had aluminum cutlery for special guests while
    others used gold/silver. After Hall-Heroult process made aluminum extraction
    feasible, price dropped dramatically.'

  question: Which extraction method involves heating the ore in limited air to remove
    moisture and CO₂?
  options:
  - Roasting
  - Calcination
  - Smelting
  - Leaching
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Calcination
  explanation: '**Calcination** = heating ore in **limited or absent air** to remove
    volatile impurities like H₂O, CO₂, organic matter. Examples: (1) ZnCO₃ → ZnO
    + CO₂ (zinc carbonate to zinc oxide), (2) CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ (limestone to quicklime),
    (3) Al₂O₃·2H₂O → Al₂O₃ + 2H₂O (hydrated alumina to alumina). Used for: carbonate
    ores, hydrated ores. **Roasting** = heating ore in **excess air/oxygen** to convert
    sulfides to oxides. Examples: 2ZnS + 3O₂ → 2ZnO + 2SO₂, 2Cu₂S + 3O₂ → 2Cu₂O
    + 2SO₂. Used for: sulfide ores. **Key difference**: Air supply! Calcination (limited
    air) vs Roasting (excess air). **Smelting** = heating ore with reducing agent
    (C, CO) to obtain metal. Example: ZnO + C → Zn + CO. **Leaching** = chemical
    extraction using solvents (not heating). Example: Bauxite (Al₂O₃) + NaOH → NaAlO₂
    (Bayer process).'
