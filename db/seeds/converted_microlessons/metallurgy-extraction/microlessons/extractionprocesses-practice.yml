  Calcination is heating in limited or no air (removes H₂O, CO₂). Roasting is heating
  in excess air (converts sulfides to oxides). Example: ZnCO₃ → ZnO (calcination),
  2ZnS + 3O₂ → 2ZnO (roasting).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the main difference between calcination and roasting?
  options:
  - Calcination uses excess air, roasting uses limited air
  - Calcination uses limited/no air, roasting uses excess air
  - Both processes are identical
  - Calcination is only for sulfides, roasting only for carbonates
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Calcination uses limited/no air, roasting uses excess air
  explanation: 'Calcination and roasting are both heating processes used in metallurgy
    but differ in air supply: **Calcination** = heating ore in limited or absent air
    supply. Used for carbonate and hydrated ores to remove volatile impurities like
    H₂O, CO₂. Example: ZnCO₃ → ZnO + CO₂ (heating limestone: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂). **Roasting**
    = heating ore in excess air/oxygen. Used for sulfide ores to convert them to oxides.
    Example: 2ZnS + 3O₂ → 2ZnO + 2SO₂ (copper: 2Cu₂S + 3O₂ → 2Cu₂O + 2SO₂). The key
    difference is oxygen availability: calcination excludes it, roasting requires
    it.'

  question: 'Which process is used to convert carbonate ores to oxides?'
  options:
  - Roasting
  - Calcination
  - Smelting
  - Leaching
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Calcination
  explanation: '**Calcination** converts carbonate and hydrated ores to oxides by
    heating in limited/absent air: Examples of carbonate ore calcination: (1) **ZnCO₃
    → ZnO + CO₂** (zinc carbonate to zinc oxide), (2) **CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂** (limestone
    to quicklime), (3) **FeCO₃ → FeO + CO₂** (siderite to iron oxide), (4) **MgCO₃
    → MgO + CO₂** (magnesite to magnesia). Hydrated ore examples: (5) **Al₂O₃·2H₂O
    → Al₂O₃ + 2H₂O** (bauxite dehydration), (6) **CuSO₄·5H₂O → CuSO₄ + 5H₂O**. Why
    limited air? To prevent unwanted oxidation reactions. The ore is heated in kilns/furnaces
    below the decomposition temperature. Temperature range: 800-1000°C typically.
    **Roasting vs Calcination**: Roasting = sulfides → oxides (needs excess O₂),
    Calcination = carbonates/hydrates → oxides (limited air). **Smelting** = reduction
    of oxide to metal (needs reducing agent). **Leaching** = chemical dissolution
    (no heating). Mnemonic: **CAL**cination for **CAL**cium carbonate (CaCO₃)!'

  question: What type of ore requires roasting as a preliminary step before reduction?
  options:
  - Oxide ores
  - Sulfide ores
  - Carbonate ores
  - Halide ores
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Sulfide ores
  explanation: '**Sulfide ores must be roasted** before reduction to convert them
    to oxides: Why? Sulfides cannot be directly reduced by carbon (thermodynamically
    unfavorable). They must first be converted to oxides. Roasting reactions: (1)
    **2ZnS + 3O₂ → 2ZnO + 2SO₂** (zinc blende), (2) **2PbS + 3O₂ → 2PbO + 2SO₂**
    (galena), (3) **2Cu₂S + 3O₂ → 2Cu₂O + 2SO₂** (copper glance), (4) **4FeS₂ +
    11O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃ + 8SO₂** (iron pyrites). Process: Ore is heated strongly in excess
    air in a reverberatory furnace or fluidized bed. Temperature: 500-800°C typically.
    Products: Metal oxide (desired) + SO₂ (problematic). Environmental concern: SO₂
    is a pollutant causing acid rain. Modern plants capture SO₂ to make sulfuric
    acid (H₂SO₄), turning waste into valuable product! After roasting, the oxide
    is reduced: ZnO + C → Zn + CO (for example). **Oxide ores** can be reduced directly.
    **Carbonate ores** need calcination, not roasting.'
