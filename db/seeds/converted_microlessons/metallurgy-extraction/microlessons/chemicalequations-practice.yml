  Balanced equation: 2ZnS + 3O₂ → 2ZnO + 2SO₂. This is the roasting of zinc sulfide
  to convert it to zinc oxide before reduction.

  question: 'Which of the following represents the thermite reaction for aluminum
    extraction?'
  options:
  - Fe₂O₃ + 2Al → 2Fe + Al₂O₃
  - 2Al₂O₃ → 4Al + 3O₂
  - Al₂O₃ + 3C → 2Al + 3CO
  - 2Al + 3H₂O → Al₂O₃ + 3H₂
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Fe₂O₃ + 2Al → 2Fe + Al₂O₃
  explanation: 'The thermite reaction is an **aluminothermic process** where aluminum
    reduces metal oxides: **Fe₂O₃ + 2Al → 2Fe + Al₂O₃**. This is a highly exothermic
    reaction (releases enormous heat, temperature reaches ~2500°C). Process: (1) Aluminum
    powder mixed with iron oxide (rust), (2) Ignited with magnesium ribbon, (3) Produces
    molten iron and aluminum oxide slag. The reaction is so vigorous that iron becomes
    white-hot and molten! Applications: (1) Welding railway tracks (thermite welding),
    (2) Incendiary devices (military), (3) Emergency cutting through metal. Why aluminum?
    Aluminum has higher affinity for oxygen than iron (more reactive), so it displaces
    iron from its oxide. This demonstrates the reactivity series: more reactive metals
    can displace less reactive metals from their compounds. The thermite reaction
    is NOT used for aluminum extraction itself - aluminum is extracted by electrolysis
    of Al₂O₃.'

  question: 'In the blast furnace for iron extraction, which reaction reduces Fe₂O₃
    to iron?'
  options:
  - Fe₂O₃ + 3C → 2Fe + 3CO
  - Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂
  - Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂ → 2Fe + 3H₂O
  - 2Fe₂O₃ + 3O₂ → 4Fe + 3CO₂
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂
  explanation: 'Iron extraction in blast furnace involves **carbon monoxide as the
    main reducing agent**: **Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂**. The process occurs in stages:
    (1) Coke (C) burns in hot air: **C + O₂ → CO₂** (exothermic, provides heat),
    (2) CO₂ reacts with more coke: **CO₂ + C → 2CO** (endothermic, produces reducing
    agent), (3) CO reduces iron ore: **Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂** (main reduction).
    The reduction actually happens in three steps: Fe₂O₃ → Fe₃O₄ → FeO → Fe (gradual
    reduction). Temperature zones in blast furnace: Bottom (1900°C) - molten iron
    collects, Middle (800-1200°C) - reduction occurs, Top (200-400°C) - heating and
    drying. Common misconception: While carbon (C) does reduce some iron oxide directly
    (Fe₂O₃ + 3C → 2Fe + 3CO), the **primary reducing agent is CO, not C**. This makes
    the process more efficient at lower temperatures.'
