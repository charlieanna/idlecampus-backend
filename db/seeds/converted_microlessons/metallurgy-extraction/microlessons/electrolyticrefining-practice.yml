  question: In electrolytic refining of copper, the impurities like gold and silver
    settle at the bottom as ________.
  require_pass: true

  question: In electrolytic refining of copper, what happens at the anode and cathode?
  options:
  - Pure Cu at anode dissolves, impure Cu deposits at cathode
  - Impure Cu at anode dissolves, pure Cu deposits at cathode
  - Both electrodes are made of pure copper
  - Cu²⁺ ions are reduced at the anode
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Impure Cu at anode dissolves, pure Cu deposits at cathode
  explanation: 'Electrolytic refining of copper: **Setup**: Anode = impure copper
    (blister copper ~99% pure), Cathode = thin sheet of pure copper, Electrolyte
    = acidified CuSO₄ solution. **At ANODE (+)**: Impure copper oxidizes and dissolves:
    **Cu → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻** (copper goes into solution). **At CATHODE (−)**: Cu²⁺ ions
    get reduced and deposit as pure copper: **Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu** (pure copper deposits).
    **Fate of impurities**: (1) More reactive metals (Fe, Zn, Ni) dissolve but remain
    in solution (don''t deposit, as their reduction potential is lower). (2) Less
    reactive metals (Au, Ag, Pt) do NOT dissolve and fall to the bottom as **anode
    mud** (valuable byproduct!). The anode mud is processed to extract precious metals,
    making copper refining economically attractive. This process produces 99.99%
    pure copper, essential for electrical applications where even trace impurities
    reduce conductivity significantly.'

  question: Which metal is commonly purified by electrolytic refining?
  options:
  - Sodium
  - Aluminum
  - Copper
  - Calcium
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Copper
  explanation: '**Copper** is the most commonly purified metal by electrolytic refining
    to achieve 99.99% purity required for electrical applications. The process: Impure
    Cu (anode) → Cu²⁺ (solution) → Pure Cu (cathode). Why copper needs such high
    purity: Electrical conductivity is extremely sensitive to impurities. Even 0.1%
    impurity can reduce conductivity by 5-10%, affecting performance in wires, circuits,
    motors. Other metals refined electrolytically: Silver (Ag), Gold (Au), Nickel
    (Ni), Zinc (Zn), Lead (Pb). Metals NOT refined electrolytically: (1) Highly reactive
    metals (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Al) - extracted by electrolysis but not refined this way
    as they''re too reactive and would react with aqueous electrolytes. (2) Metals
    refined by other methods: Iron (by oxidation to remove C, S, P), Titanium (by
    Kroll process using Mg). Advantage: Produces ultra-pure metal. Disadvantage:
    Energy-intensive and slow process.'
