  Froth flotation is used for sulfide ores (ZnS, PbS, Cu₂S). Sulfide ore particles
  are preferentially wetted by oil and float with froth, while gangue sinks.


  ## Key Points

  question: Which concentration method is used for sulfide ores?
  options:
  - Hydraulic washing
  - Froth flotation
  - Magnetic separation
  - Calcination
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Froth flotation
  explanation: 'Froth flotation is the concentration method specifically used for
    sulfide ores (ZnS, PbS, Cu₂S, etc.). The process works based on differences in
    wettability: (1) Crushed ore is mixed with water and frothing agents (pine oil)
    and collectors (potassium ethyl xanthate), (2) Sulfide ore particles are preferentially
    wetted by oil (hydrophobic) and attach to air bubbles, (3) These float to the
    surface as froth which is skimmed off, (4) Gangue (rocky impurities) is wetted
    by water (hydrophilic) and sinks. This method is highly selective and can concentrate
    complex ores. Other methods: hydraulic washing (gravity-based), magnetic separation
    (for magnetic ores like Fe₃O₄).'

  question: Which concentration method is used for magnetic ores like magnetite (Fe₃O₄)?
  options:
  - Froth flotation
  - Magnetic separation
  - Hydraulic washing
  - Leaching
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Magnetic separation
  explanation: '**Magnetic separation** concentrates ores with magnetic properties:
    Process: (1) Crushed ore is fed onto a conveyor belt, (2) Belt passes over powerful
    electromagnets or permanent magnets, (3) **Magnetic particles** (ore) are attracted
    and separated, (4) **Non-magnetic particles** (gangue) fall away. Used for: **Magnetite**
    (Fe₃O₄) - strongly magnetic iron ore, **Pyrolusite** (MnO₂) - weakly magnetic,
    **Wolframite** (FeWO₄) - tungsten ore. Principle: Based on magnetic susceptibility
    differences between ore and gangue. The ore mineral is attracted to the magnetic
    field while gangue is not. Types of separators: (1) Low-intensity (for strongly
    magnetic ores like Fe₃O₄), (2) High-intensity (for weakly magnetic ores). Advantages:
    (1) Simple and economical, (2) Environmentally friendly (no chemicals), (3) Can
    handle large volumes. Other concentration methods: Froth flotation (sulfides),
    Hydraulic washing/Gravity separation (based on density), Leaching (chemical dissolution).'

  question: 'What is the principle behind hydraulic washing for ore concentration?'
  options:
  - Differences in magnetic properties
  - Differences in density/specific gravity
  - Differences in chemical reactivity
  - Differences in electrical conductivity
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Differences in density/specific gravity
  explanation: '**Hydraulic washing** (gravity separation) concentrates ores based
    on **density differences**: Process: (1) Crushed ore is fed onto a sloping surface
    with water flowing over it, (2) **Lighter gangue particles** (lower density)
    are washed away by water current, (3) **Heavier ore particles** (higher density)
    settle and move down the slope. Used for: Oxide ores (haematite Fe₂O₃, tinstone
    SnO₂), Native metals (gold, platinum). Principle: Stokes'' law - settling velocity
    depends on density. Denser particles settle faster and separate from lighter
    impurities. Equipment: Wilfley table (shaking table with grooves), Hydraulic
    classifier, Jigs (pulsating water). Example: **Gold panning** - manual hydraulic
    washing where gold (density 19.3 g/cm³) settles while sand (density 2.6 g/cm³)
    is washed away. Requirements: (1) Significant density difference between ore
    and gangue (at least 2-3 times), (2) Ores should not be too fine (particle size
    >0.1 mm). Advantages: Simple, cheap, no chemicals. Limitations: Not effective
    for very fine particles or when density difference is small.'
