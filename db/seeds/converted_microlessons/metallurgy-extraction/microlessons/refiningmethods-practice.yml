  Mond process: Ni + 4CO → Ni(CO)₄ (50-60°C, volatile) → Ni + 4CO (180°C, decomposition).
  This gives very pure nickel.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which statements about the Mond process are correct?
  options:
  - It is used for refining nickel using CO at different temperatures
  - It produces volatile Ni(CO)₄ which decomposes to pure nickel
  - Both statements are correct
  - Neither statement is correct
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Both statements are correct
  explanation: 'The **Mond process** refines impure nickel to 99.99% purity using
    carbonyl formation: **Step 1 (50-60°C)**: Impure Ni + 4CO → Ni(CO)₄ (nickel
    tetracarbonyl, volatile gas). Impurities don''t form carbonyls and remain behind.
    **Step 2 (180-200°C)**: Ni(CO)₄ → Ni + 4CO (decomposition to pure nickel). The
    CO is recycled back to Step 1. Why it works: (1) Ni(CO)₄ is volatile (boiling
    point 43°C) while nickel metal is solid (melting point 1455°C), (2) Temperature
    control: low temp for formation, high temp for decomposition, (3) Reversible
    reaction allows CO recycling. Advantages: Produces extremely pure nickel (99.99%+),
    Used in electronics and special alloys. Disadvantage: Ni(CO)₄ is highly toxic
    and carcinogenic! Similar processes: van Arkel method (refining Zr, Ti using
    iodides), Parkes process (removing Ag from Pb using Zn).'

  question: Zone refining is most suitable for purifying which type of materials?
  options:
  - Metals with high melting points only
  - Semiconductors and metals requiring ultra-high purity
  - All metals regardless of purity requirements
  - Only radioactive materials
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Semiconductors and metals requiring ultra-high purity
  explanation: '**Zone refining** (or zone melting) produces ultra-pure materials
    by repeatedly passing a molten zone through a solid rod: Process: (1) A rod of
    impure metal is taken, (2) A narrow region is heated and melted (the "zone"),
    (3) The heater slowly moves along the rod, (4) Impurities concentrate in the
    molten zone and move with it, (5) Pure metal crystallizes behind the moving zone,
    (6) Process repeated many times (10-15 passes), (7) Impurities accumulate at
    one end, which is cut off. Principle: Impurities are more soluble in molten state
    than solid state (distribution coefficient k < 1). Applications: **Semiconductors**
    (Si, Ge) - Requires 99.9999999% purity (9N) for electronics! **Ultra-pure metals**
    (Ga, In) for special applications. Advantage: Can achieve impurity levels below
    1 ppb (part per billion). Disadvantage: Very slow and expensive process, only
    economical for high-value materials.'

  question: 'Which refining method is based on differences in vapor pressures?'
  options:
  - Liquation
  - Distillation
  - Poling
  - Cupellation
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Distillation
  explanation: '**Distillation** refines metals based on differences in vapor pressure
    (or boiling points): Process: Impure metal is heated in vacuum or inert atmosphere.
    The metal vaporizes and condenses elsewhere, leaving impurities behind. Used
    for: **Zinc** (bp 907°C), **Mercury** (bp 357°C), **Cadmium** (bp 767°C) - metals
    with relatively low boiling points. Example: Crude zinc is heated to ~1000°C
    in retorts, zinc vapor condenses in cooler regions as pure metal. Other refining
    methods: **Liquation** (melting-based): Low melting metal (like tin, bp 232°C)
    melts and drains away from high-melting impurities on a sloping hearth. **Poling**
    (oxidation + reduction): For Cu containing Cu₂O. Green wood poles are thrust
    into molten Cu, producing reducing gases (CO, CH₄) that reduce Cu₂O to Cu. **Cupellation**
    (oxidative): Refining Ag/Au by oxidizing base metal impurities (Pb, Cu, Zn) which
    form oxides and are absorbed by porous cupel, leaving pure noble metals. Each
    method exploits different physical/chemical properties!'
