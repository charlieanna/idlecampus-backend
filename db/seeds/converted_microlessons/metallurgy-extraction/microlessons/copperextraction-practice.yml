  Copper extraction uses self-reduction: 2Cu₂O + Cu₂S → 6Cu + SO₂. Cu₂S acts as reducing
  agent for Cu₂O, no external reducing agent needed.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which process involves self-reduction?
  options:
  - Extraction of iron from Fe₂O₃
  - Extraction of copper from Cu₂S
  - Extraction of aluminum from Al₂O₃
  - Extraction of zinc from ZnO
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Extraction of copper from Cu₂S
  explanation: 'Copper extraction from Cu₂S involves self-reduction (auto-reduction),
    where no external reducing agent is needed. The process: (1) Roasting: 2Cu₂S +
    3O₂ → 2Cu₂O + 2SO₂ (partial oxidation), (2) Self-reduction: 2Cu₂O + Cu₂S → 6Cu
    + SO₂ (Cu₂S acts as reducing agent for Cu₂O). In this clever process, Cu₂S reduces
    Cu₂O to metallic copper while being oxidized to SO₂. This is economically advantageous
    as it doesn''t require expensive reducing agents like coke (used for iron: Fe₂O₃
    + 3C → 2Fe + 3CO) or electrolysis (used for aluminum: Al₂O₃ → Al). The self-reduction
    is unique to copper and a few other metals.'

  question: What is the composition of copper matte obtained after smelting copper
    ore?
  options:
  - Pure copper metal
  - Mixture of Cu₂S and FeS
  - Mixture of Cu₂O and Fe₂O₃
  - Mixture of CuO and slag
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Mixture of Cu₂S and FeS
  explanation: 'Copper extraction from sulfide ores (chalcopyrite CuFeS₂) produces
    **copper matte**: **Step 1 - Concentration**: Froth flotation enriches the ore.
    **Step 2 - Roasting**: Partial oxidation in reverberatory furnace: 2CuFeS₂ +
    O₂ → Cu₂S + 2FeS + SO₂ (controlled heating). **Step 3 - Smelting**: Heating
    with silica (SiO₂) as flux: FeS oxidizes: 2FeS + 3O₂ → 2FeO + 2SO₂, FeO + SiO₂
    → FeSiO₃ (slag, removed). **Copper matte** = Cu₂S + FeS (40-50% Cu). **Step
    4 - Bessemerization**: Air blown through molten matte: 2FeS + 3O₂ → 2FeO + 2SO₂
    (removes remaining FeS), 2Cu₂S + 3O₂ → 2Cu₂O + 2SO₂ (partial oxidation), **Self-reduction**:
    2Cu₂O + Cu₂S → 6Cu + SO₂. Product: **Blister copper** (~98-99% pure, contains
    SO₂ bubbles). **Step 5 - Refining**: Electrolytic refining gives 99.99% pure
    copper for electrical use.'

  question: 'Why is copper obtained from the self-reduction process called "blister
    copper"?'
  options:
  - It has a shiny blister-like appearance
  - It contains SO₂ gas bubbles that create blisters on solidification
  - It is shaped like blisters during casting
  - It has blister-shaped impurities
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: It contains SO₂ gas bubbles that create blisters on solidification
  explanation: '**Blister copper** (98-99% pure) is named for its appearance: During
    self-reduction: 2Cu₂O + Cu₂S → 6Cu + SO₂, **SO₂ gas is produced** and gets trapped
    in the molten copper. When the molten copper solidifies, these **SO₂ gas bubbles
    create blister-like protrusions** on the surface, giving it a characteristic
    pockmarked appearance. Properties of blister copper: Purity ~98-99% Cu, Contains
    dissolved gases (SO₂, O₂), Has blistered/pitted surface, Still contains impurities
    (Fe, Zn, Ag, Au, Pt). **Further purification needed**: Blister copper must undergo
    electrolytic refining to achieve 99.99% purity required for electrical applications
    (wires, circuits). Why such high purity? Electrical conductivity is extremely
    sensitive to impurities - even 0.1% impurity reduces conductivity significantly.
    The impurities settle as anode mud containing precious metals (Ag, Au, Pt), which
    are recovered as valuable byproducts, making copper refining economically attractive!'
