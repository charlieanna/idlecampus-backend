  question: In the Ellingham diagram, a lower line indicates a ________ stable oxide.
  require_pass: true

  question: According to the Ellingham diagram, which statement is correct about using
    carbon to reduce metal oxides?
  options:
  - Carbon can reduce all metal oxides at any temperature
  - Carbon can reduce a metal oxide only if the carbon line is below the metal oxide
      line
  - Carbon can reduce a metal oxide only if the carbon line is above the metal oxide
      line
  - The position of lines doesn't matter for reduction
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Carbon can reduce a metal oxide only if the carbon line is below
    the metal oxide line
  explanation: 'Understanding Ellingham diagrams for predicting reduction: A metal
    oxide can be reduced by carbon (or any reducing agent) only if the **reducing
    agent''s line lies BELOW the metal oxide line** at that temperature. Why? Lower
    line = more negative ΔG = more stable oxide = stronger affinity for oxygen. When
    C line is below MO line: C + O₂ → CO₂ is more favorable than M + O₂ → MO, so
    carbon "steals" oxygen from metal oxide: **MO + C → M + CO** (or CO₂). Example:
    In iron extraction, at 700°C, the C→CO line crosses below Fe₂O₃ line, making
    reduction feasible: Fe₂O₃ + 3C → 2Fe + 3CO. Key observations: (1) **Al₂O₃ line
    is always below C line** → carbon cannot reduce Al₂O₃ (aluminum requires electrolysis).
    (2) **ZnO, Fe₂O₃, CuO lines cross above C line** at high temperatures → these
    can be reduced by carbon. (3) Temperature matters! Some reductions only become
    feasible above certain temperatures where lines cross.'

  question: 'Why do most metal oxide lines in the Ellingham diagram have a positive
    slope?'
  options:
  - Because ΔG increases with temperature due to entropy factor (−TΔS)
  - Because reactions become less favorable at higher temperatures
  - Because metal oxides decompose at high temperatures
  - Because oxygen pressure increases with temperature
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Because ΔG increases with temperature due to entropy factor (−TΔS)
  explanation: 'Ellingham diagram slopes explained using thermodynamics: From **ΔG
    = ΔH − TΔS**, the slope of each line = **−ΔS** (entropy change). For most oxidation
    reactions like **2M + O₂ → 2MO**: (1) Reactants: 2 solid + 1 gas = 3 particles
    (high entropy), (2) Products: 2 solid = 2 particles (lower entropy), (3) **ΔS
    is negative** (entropy decreases as gas is consumed), (4) Therefore, slope =
    −ΔS = positive (upward slope). As temperature increases, the −TΔS term becomes
    more positive, making ΔG less negative (reaction becomes less favorable). **Exception
    - Carbon oxidation has negative slope**: 2C + O₂ → 2CO produces gas (ΔS positive),
    so slope = −ΔS = negative. This is why carbon lines slope downward! This negative
    slope causes carbon lines to intersect metal oxide lines at certain temperatures,
    making reduction possible above those temperatures. The Ellingham diagram brilliantly
    visualizes thermodynamic feasibility of reactions across temperatures.'
