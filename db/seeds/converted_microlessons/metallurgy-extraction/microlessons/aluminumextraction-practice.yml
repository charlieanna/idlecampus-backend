  Cryolite lowers the melting point of Al₂O₃ from 2050°C to ~950°C and increases electrical
  conductivity of the electrolyte, making the electrolytic process more economical.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Why is cryolite (Na₃AlF₆) added to alumina (Al₂O₃) in the Hall-Heroult
    process?
  options:
  - To increase the melting point of alumina
  - To decrease the melting point and increase electrical conductivity
  - To act as a reducing agent
  - To prevent oxidation of aluminum
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: To decrease the melting point and increase electrical conductivity
  explanation: 'Cryolite (Na₃AlF₆) serves two critical functions in aluminum extraction:
    (1) **Lowers melting point**: Pure Al₂O₃ melts at 2050°C, but with cryolite it
    melts at ~950°C, saving enormous energy. (2) **Increases electrical conductivity**:
    Makes the electrolyte more conductive, improving electrolysis efficiency. The
    Hall-Heroult process: Purified alumina (Al₂O₃) dissolved in molten cryolite undergoes
    electrolysis. At cathode (−): Al³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Al (aluminum deposited), At anode
    (+): 2O²⁻ → O₂ + 4e⁻ (oxygen released, reacts with carbon anode forming CO₂).
    Overall: 2Al₂O₃ + 3C → 4Al + 3CO₂. The carbon anodes are continuously consumed
    and must be replaced. Modern plants also add AlF₃ to further lower melting point.
    This process consumes massive electricity (~15,000 kWh per ton of Al), making
    aluminum production energy-intensive. Recycling aluminum saves 95% of this energy!'

  question: What is the role of carbon (graphite) electrodes in the Hall-Heroult process?
  options:
  - They act as cathode where Al is deposited
  - They act as anode and get oxidized to CO₂
  - They act as reducing agent for Al₂O₃
  - They increase electrical resistance
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: They act as anode and get oxidized to CO₂
  explanation: 'In the Hall-Heroult process for aluminum extraction, **carbon (graphite)
    rods serve as anodes** (positive electrodes): (1) Oxygen ions (O²⁻) migrate to
    anode, (2) Get discharged: 2O²⁻ → O₂ + 4e⁻, (3) **Oxygen immediately reacts with
    carbon anode**: C + O₂ → CO₂ (or 2C + O₂ → 2CO at high temp). This means **anodes
    are continuously consumed** and need regular replacement (every 2-3 weeks). The
    cathode is the steel lining at the bottom of the cell where molten aluminum collects.
    Why graphite? High melting point (3600°C), good electrical conductor, relatively
    inexpensive. Disadvantage: Anode consumption produces CO₂ (greenhouse gas). Research
    focuses on developing "inert anodes" (non-consumable) that would release only
    O₂, making aluminum production more environmentally friendly. Currently, ~1.5
    kg of carbon is consumed per kg of aluminum produced.'

  question: 'Which statement about the Hall-Heroult process is INCORRECT?'
  options:
  - Molten aluminum sinks to the bottom as it is denser than cryolite
  - The process operates at approximately 950°C
  - Oxygen is released at the cathode
  - The process consumes large amounts of electricity
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Oxygen is released at the cathode
  explanation: 'Analyzing each statement about aluminum extraction: **(A) TRUE**:
    Molten aluminum (density ~2.3 g/cm³) sinks to the bottom, being denser than the
    cryolite-alumina mixture (~2.1 g/cm³). It''s collected from the bottom. **(B)
    TRUE**: Operating temperature is ~950-970°C, much lower than Al₂O₃ melting point
    (2050°C) thanks to cryolite. **(C) FALSE**: **Oxygen is released at the ANODE
    (positive), not cathode**. At anode: O²⁻ → O₂ (then O₂ + C → CO₂). At cathode:
    Al³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Al. This is a common misconception! **(D) TRUE**: The process is
    extremely energy-intensive (~15,000 kWh per ton of Al). This is why aluminum
    plants are often built near cheap hydroelectric power sources. Electrolysis basics:
    Anions (negative ions like O²⁻) go to anode (+), Cations (positive ions like
    Al³⁺) go to cathode (−). Remember: "Anions to Anodes" and "Cations to Cathodes"
    (alphabetical order).'
