  TRUE. CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂, then CaO + SiO₂ → CaSiO₃ (slag). The slag is molten and
  less dense than iron, so it floats and can be removed.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.

  question: What is the main function of coke in the blast furnace for iron extraction?
  options:
  - To provide heat and produce reducing agent CO
  - To remove impurities as slag
  - To increase the melting point of iron
  - To prevent oxidation of iron
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: To provide heat and produce reducing agent CO
  explanation: 'Coke (pure carbon) serves multiple critical functions in blast furnace:
    **1. Fuel (heat source)**: C + O₂ → CO₂ + heat (exothermic, raises temperature
    to ~1900°C at bottom). **2. Produces reducing agent**: CO₂ + C → 2CO (carbon
    monoxide, the main reducing agent). **3. Reduction of iron ore**: Fe₂O₃ + 3CO
    → 2Fe + 3CO₂ (occurs in middle zone at 800-1200°C). The blast furnace operates
    continuously with three main inputs: (1) Iron ore (haematite Fe₂O₃ or magnetite
    Fe₃O₄), (2) Coke (C), (3) Limestone (CaCO₃, flux). Temperature zones: Top (200-400°C)
    - ore preheating and moisture removal, Middle (800-1200°C) - reduction zone (CO
    reduces Fe₂O₃), Bottom (1400-1900°C) - melting zone (molten iron collects). Two
    products: Molten iron (denser, collects at bottom), Slag (CaSiO₃, lighter, floats
    on top). Iron produced is "pig iron" containing ~4% C, which is further refined
    to steel.'

  question: 'Which reaction occurs in the hottest zone of the blast furnace?'
  options:
  - CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂
  - C + O₂ → CO₂
  - Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂
  - CO₂ + C → 2CO
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: C + O₂ → CO₂
  explanation: 'Temperature zones in blast furnace and their reactions: **BOTTOM
    (Hottest zone, 1400-1900°C)**: **C + O₂ → CO₂** (coke combustion with hot air
    blast). This highly exothermic reaction provides the heat needed for the entire
    process. Molten iron and slag collect here. **MIDDLE (800-1200°C)**: **CO₂ +
    C → 2CO** (formation of reducing agent), **Fe₂O₃ + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO₂** (main
    reduction), FeO is further reduced to Fe. **UPPER-MIDDLE (500-800°C)**: **CaCO₃
    → CaO + CO₂** (limestone decomposition), **CaO + SiO₂ → CaSiO₃** (slag formation).
    **TOP (200-400°C)**: Preheating of ore, removal of moisture, initial warming.
    The process is a brilliant example of counter-current heat exchange: hot gases
    rise (heating incoming materials), cold materials descend (cooling gases). Material
    movement: downward, Gas movement: upward. This efficient design maximizes heat
    utilization and reduces fuel consumption.'
