  Correct sequence: (1) Concentration → (3) Roasting/Calcination → (2) Reduction in
  blast furnace → (4) Collection of molten iron. This is the systematic metallurgical
  process.

  question: 'What is the correct sequence of steps in the general metallurgical extraction
    process?'
  options:
  - Concentration → Calcination/Roasting → Reduction → Refining
  - Reduction → Concentration → Roasting → Refining
  - Roasting → Reduction → Concentration → Refining
  - Concentration → Reduction → Roasting → Refining
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Concentration → Calcination/Roasting → Reduction → Refining
  explanation: 'The systematic metallurgical extraction process follows these steps:
    **1. CONCENTRATION (Ore enrichment)**: Removal of unwanted rocky material (gangue)
    from ore using methods like: Froth flotation (for sulfide ores), Magnetic separation
    (for magnetic ores like Fe₃O₄), Hydraulic washing (gravity-based), Leaching (chemical,
    e.g., Bayer process for Al). **2. CALCINATION/ROASTING (Ore preparation)**: Calcination
    = heating in limited air (removes H₂O, CO₂ from carbonates/hydrates), Roasting
    = heating in excess air (converts sulfides → oxides). **3. REDUCTION (Metal extraction)**:
    Converting metal compound to free metal using: Electrolytic reduction (Na, K,
    Ca, Mg, Al), Carbon/CO reduction (Fe, Zn, Pb), Self-reduction (Cu, Hg). **4.
    REFINING (Purification)**: Removing remaining impurities using: Electrolytic
    refining (Cu, Ag, Au), Mond process (Ni), Zone refining (Si, Ge), Distillation
    (Zn, Hg). This sequence ensures efficient extraction with maximum purity and
    minimum waste.'

  question: 'Why is concentration the first step in metallurgical extraction?'
  options:
  - To increase the percentage of metal in the ore and reduce processing costs
  - To convert the ore into its oxide form
  - To remove moisture from the ore
  - To reduce the melting point of the ore
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: To increase the percentage of metal in the ore and reduce processing
    costs
  explanation: 'Concentration (ore dressing/beneficiation) is the crucial first step
    because: **Primary reason**: Ores typically contain only 2-10% metal, rest is
    gangue (unwanted rocky material like sand, clay, silicates). Processing large
    quantities of gangue wastes: (1) Energy (heating huge amounts of waste), (2)
    Time (slower reactions), (3) Money (transportation, storage), (4) Chemicals (more
    reagents needed). **By concentrating first**: Ore enriched to 20-60% metal content,
    making subsequent steps economically viable. Example: Iron ore (haematite) might
    be 30% Fe initially, after concentration becomes 60-70% Fe. This halves the material
    volume! **Methods depend on ore type**: Physical differences (density, magnetism,
    wettability) or Chemical differences (solubility). **Economic impact**: A mine
    producing 1000 tons of crude ore might concentrate it to 200 tons of enriched
    ore, reducing transportation and processing costs by 80%. Without concentration,
    many low-grade ores would be uneconomical to process. Modern technology allows
    extraction from ores as lean as 0.5% metal (e.g., copper porphyry deposits).'
