  # Pressure and Pascal's Law

  ## Pressure Definition

  **Force per unit area** acting perpendicular to surface.

  ```
  P = F/A

  Unit: Pascal (Pa) = N/m² = kg/(m·s²)
  ```

  ### Other Units:
  - 1 atm = 101325 Pa ≈ 10⁵ Pa
  - 1 bar = 10⁵ Pa
  - 1 torr = 133.3 Pa
  - 1 mm Hg = 133.3 Pa

  ## Pressure in Fluids

  ### Key Properties:
  1. **Acts in all directions** equally at a point
  2. **Increases with depth**
  3. **Acts perpendicular** to any surface
  4. **Independent of shape** of container

  ### Pressure at Depth:
  ```
  P = P₀ + ρgh

  P₀ = atmospheric pressure (at surface)
  ρ = fluid density
  g = acceleration due to gravity
  h = depth below surface
  ```

  ## Atmospheric Pressure

  **Pressure exerted by atmosphere:**
  ```
  P_atm = 1.013 × 10⁵ Pa = 760 mm Hg = 10.3 m of water

  Height of atmosphere if uniform density: ~8 km
  ```

  ### Torricelli's Experiment:
  Mercury column of 76 cm (760 mm) balances atmospheric pressure.
  ```
  P_atm = ρ_Hg × g × h = 13600 × 10 × 0.76 ≈ 10⁵ Pa
  ```

  ## Types of Pressure

  ### 1. Absolute Pressure:
  ```
  P_abs = P_atm + P_gauge

  Total pressure including atmospheric
  ```

  ### 2. Gauge Pressure:
  ```
  P_gauge = P_abs - P_atm

  Pressure above atmospheric (can be negative)
  ```

  ### 3. Vacuum Pressure:
  ```
  P_vacuum = P_atm - P_abs

  When absolute pressure < atmospheric
  ```

  ## Pascal's Law

  **Statement:** Pressure applied to enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to every point in the fluid.

  ```
  ΔP₁ = ΔP₂ (at all points)

  F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂ (hydraulic system)
  ```

  ### Hydraulic Lift:
  ```
  F₂ = F₁ × (A₂/A₁)

  Mechanical advantage = A₂/A₁
  ```

  **Volume conservation:**
  ```
  A₁d₁ = A₂d₂

  d₁/d₂ = A₂/A₁
  ```

  Work done is same on both sides (energy conservation).

  ## Hydraulic Applications

  ### 1. Hydraulic Lift:
  - Small force on small piston
  - Large force on large piston
  - Used in car lifts, jacks

  ### 2. Hydraulic Brakes:
  - Uniform pressure to all wheels
  - Master cylinder to wheel cylinders

  ### 3. Hydraulic Press:
  - Compress materials with large force
  - Manufacturing applications

  ## Pressure Measurement

  ### 1. Manometer (U-tube):
  ```
  P_gas = P_atm + ρgh (open arm manometer)
  P_gas = P_atm - ρgh (if gas side higher)
  ```

  ### 2. Barometer:
  ```
  P_atm = ρ_Hg × g × h
  ```

  ### 3. Bourdon Gauge:
  - Mechanical device for high pressures
  - Measures gauge pressure directly

  ## Pressure in Accelerating Fluids

  ### Horizontal Acceleration (a):
  ```
  dP/dx = -ρa

  Free surface inclined at angle: tan θ = a/g
  ```

  ### Vertical Acceleration:
  ```
  P = ρ(g ± a)h

  '+' for upward acceleration
  '-' for downward acceleration
  ```

  **Free fall: Effective g = 0**, pressure same everywhere.

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Hydraulic lift has pistons of diameter 10 cm and 1 m. Force needed to lift 1000 kg car?

  **Solution:**
  ```
  A₁ = π(0.05)² = 7.85×10⁻³ m²
  A₂ = π(0.5)² = 0.785 m²

  F₂ = mg = 1000 × 10 = 10000 N
  F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂
  F₁ = F₂(A₁/A₂) = 10000 × (7.85×10⁻³/0.785)
  F₁ = 100 N

  Only 100 N needed to lift 10000 N!
  ```

  **Example 2:** Pressure at bottom of 10 m deep water tank (ρ = 1000 kg/m³).

  **Solution:**
  ```
  P = P_atm + ρgh
  P = 10⁵ + 1000 × 10 × 10
  P = 10⁵ + 10⁵ = 2 × 10⁵ Pa = 2 atm

  At 10 m depth, pressure doubles!
  ```

  **Example 3:** Open U-tube manometer has mercury. Gas pressure if mercury in gas arm is 5 cm higher?

  **Solution:**
  ```
  P_gas = P_atm - ρ_Hg × g × h
  P_gas = 101325 - 13600 × 10 × 0.05
  P_gas = 101325 - 6800
  P_gas ≈ 94525 Pa ≈ 0.93 atm

  Gas pressure below atmospheric (partial vacuum)
  ```

  question: "A hydraulic lift has piston areas in ratio 1:100. If 10 N force is applied on smaller piston, force on larger piston is:"
  options:
  - "10 N"
  - "100 N"
  - "1000 N"
  - "0.1 N"
  correct_answer: "1000 N"
  explanation: "By Pascal's law: F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂. Given A₂/A₁ = 100 and F₁ = 10 N. Therefore F₂ = F₁(A₂/A₁) = 10 × 100 = 1000 N. This 100× force multiplication is mechanical advantage of hydraulic systems. Note: distance moves inversely - large piston moves only 1/100 the distance. Work done: F₁d₁ = F₂d₂, so energy is conserved. This principle enables car lifts, hydraulic jacks, and braking systems. The key insight is pressure, not force, is transmitted equally."

  question: "Pressure at depth of 1 km in ocean (ρ = 1030 kg/m³) is approximately:"
  options:
  - "10 atm"
  - "100 atm"
  - "103 atm"
  - "1030 atm"
  correct_answer: "103 atm"
  explanation: "P = P_atm + ρgh = 1 atm + (1030 × 10 × 1000) Pa = 10⁵ + 1.03×10⁷ Pa ≈ 1.03×10⁷ Pa = 103 atm. At 1 km depth, pressure is about 100 atmospheres! This immense pressure is why deep sea exploration requires specially designed submarines. At deepest ocean (Mariana Trench, ~11 km), pressure exceeds 1000 atm. Fish at such depths have special adaptations - their bodies maintain internal pressure equal to external, preventing compression."

  question: "A container accelerates upward with acceleration g. Pressure at depth h in liquid inside is:"
  options:
  - "ρgh"
  - "2ρgh"
  - "0"
  - "ρgh/2"
  correct_answer: "2ρgh"
  explanation: "When container accelerates upward with 'a', effective gravity becomes (g + a). Here a = g, so g_eff = g + g = 2g. Pressure P = ρg_eff h = ρ(2g)h = 2ρgh. The liquid experiences pseudo force downward (in accelerating frame), adding to gravity. Conversely, in free fall (a = g downward), g_eff = g - g = 0, and pressure is same everywhere - fluid behaves as if weightless! This is why astronauts can drink from any orientation in space. Note: Only gauge pressure is 2ρgh; add atmospheric pressure for absolute."
