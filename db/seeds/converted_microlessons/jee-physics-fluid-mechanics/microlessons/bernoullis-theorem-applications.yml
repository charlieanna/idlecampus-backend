  # Bernoulli's Theorem and Applications

  ## Statement

  **For steady, irrotational flow of incompressible, non-viscous fluid:**
  ```
  P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant

  Along a streamline
  ```

  ## Physical Meaning

  **Energy conservation per unit volume:**
  - P = Pressure energy density
  - ½ρv² = Kinetic energy density
  - ρgh = Potential energy density

  Total = Constant along streamline

  ## Alternative Forms

  ### Per Unit Mass:
  ```
  P/ρ + v²/2 + gh = constant
  ```

  ### Per Unit Weight (Head Form):
  ```
  P/(ρg) + v²/(2g) + h = constant

  Pressure head + Velocity head + Elevation head
  ```

  ## Derivation (Energy Method)

  For fluid element moving from point 1 to 2:
  ```
  Work done = Change in KE + Change in PE

  (P₁ - P₂)V = ½m(v₂² - v₁²) + mg(h₂ - h₁)

  Dividing by V:
  P₁ - P₂ = ½ρ(v₂² - v₁²) + ρg(h₂ - h₁)

  Rearranging:
  P₁ + ½ρv₁² + ρgh₁ = P₂ + ½ρv₂² + ρgh₂
  ```

  ## Important Applications

  ### 1. Torricelli's Theorem (Efflux Velocity)

  Velocity of liquid emerging from hole at depth h:
  ```
  v = √(2gh)

  Same as free fall from height h!
  ```

  **Horizontal Range:**
  ```
  R = 2√(h(H-h))

  Maximum when h = H/2
  R_max = H
  ```

  ### 2. Venturimeter

  Measures flow rate using pressure difference:
  ```
  A₁v₁ = A₂v₂ (continuity)
  P₁ + ½ρv₁² = P₂ + ½ρv₂² (Bernoulli)

  v₁ = A₂√(2(P₁-P₂)/(ρ(A₁²-A₂²)))

  Flow rate Q = A₁v₁
  ```

  ### 3. Pitot Tube

  Measures fluid velocity:
  ```
  v = √(2(P_stagnation - P_static)/ρ)
  ```

  At stagnation point, velocity = 0, pressure is maximum.

  ### 4. Lift on Airplane Wing

  ```
  ΔP = P_bottom - P_top = ½ρ(v_top² - v_bottom²)

  Lift force F = ΔP × A
  ```

  Upper surface: Higher velocity, lower pressure
  Lower surface: Lower velocity, higher pressure

  ### 5. Magnus Effect

  Spinning ball curves due to pressure difference:
  - Rotation adds to velocity on one side
  - Subtracts on other side
  - Creates lateral force

  ### 6. Atomizer/Spray Gun

  High-speed air reduces pressure
  Liquid rises up tube
  Gets atomized

  ## Special Cases

  ### Horizontal Pipe (h = constant):
  ```
  P₁ + ½ρv₁² = P₂ + ½ρv₂²

  Higher velocity → Lower pressure
  ```

  ### Vertical Motion (v = constant):
  ```
  P₁ + ρgh₁ = P₂ + ρgh₂

  Just hydrostatic pressure variation
  ```

  ## Limitations

  Bernoulli's theorem NOT valid for:
  1. Viscous fluids
  2. Compressible fluids
  3. Unsteady flow
  4. Rotational flow
  5. Turbulent flow

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Water tank with hole 5m below surface. Find efflux velocity.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  v = √(2gh) = √(2 × 10 × 5) = √100 = 10 m/s
  ```

  **Example 2:** Venturimeter has cross-sections 10 cm² and 5 cm². Pressure difference is 20 cm of water. Find flow rate.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  v₁A₁ = v₂A₂
  v₂ = 2v₁

  P₁ - P₂ = ½ρ(v₂² - v₁²) = ½ρ(4v₁² - v₁²) = (3/2)ρv₁²

  ρg(0.2) = (3/2)ρv₁²
  v₁² = 2g(0.2)/3 = 4/3
  v₁ = 1.15 m/s

  Q = A₁v₁ = 10×10⁻⁴ × 1.15 = 1.15×10⁻³ m³/s
  ```

  **Example 3:** Airplane wing: top surface v = 70 m/s, bottom = 60 m/s. Air density = 1.2 kg/m³. Find lift per m².

  **Solution:**
  ```
  ΔP = ½ρ(v_top² - v_bottom²) = ½(1.2)(70² - 60²)
  ΔP = 0.6(4900 - 3600) = 0.6 × 1300 = 780 Pa

  Lift = 780 N/m²
  ```

  ## JEE Key Points

  1. **Bernoulli = Energy conservation** for fluids
  2. **Higher speed = Lower pressure** (venturi effect)
  3. **Torricelli's law**: v = √(2gh) for efflux
  4. **Works only for ideal fluids** (non-viscous, incompressible)
  5. **Lift force** proportional to velocity difference
  6. **Continuity + Bernoulli** solves most problems

  question: "A tank filled with water has a hole at height h from bottom. For maximum horizontal range, h should be:"
  options:
  - "At the bottom"
  - "At height H/2"
  - "At height H/3"
  - "At the top"
  correct_answer: "At height H/2"
  explanation: "Efflux velocity v = √(2g(H-h)). Time to reach ground t = √(2h/g). Range R = vt = √(2g(H-h)) × √(2h/g) = 2√(h(H-h)). For maximum R: dR/dh = 0. d[h(H-h)]/dh = H - 2h = 0, so h = H/2. At h = H/2: R_max = 2√((H/2)(H/2)) = H. This means water from middle of tank travels farthest horizontally. Lower holes have higher speed but less flight time; upper holes have more time but lower speed."

  question: "Water flows through a horizontal pipe. At one point diameter is 4 cm (pressure 10 kPa), at another it's 2 cm. Pressure at second point is:"
  options:
  - "2.5 kPa"
  - "40 kPa"
  - "8.5 kPa"
  - "-5 kPa"
  correct_answer: "8.5 kPa"
  explanation: "By continuity: A₁v₁ = A₂v₂, so v₂/v₁ = A₁/A₂ = (4²)/(2²) = 4. Let v₁ = v, then v₂ = 4v. Using Bernoulli (horizontal, h same): P₁ + ½ρv₁² = P₂ + ½ρv₂². 10000 + ½ρv² = P₂ + ½ρ(16v²). P₂ = 10000 - (15/2)ρv². For this to give 8.5 kPa: 10000 - P₂ = 1500 Pa = 7.5ρv². v = √(200/ρ) ≈ 0.45 m/s. The key point: narrower section has higher velocity but lower pressure (venturi effect)."

  question: "An airplane wing has velocity 250 m/s over top and 200 m/s under bottom. If wing area is 100 m² and air density 0.9 kg/m³, lift force is:"
  options:
  - "101.25 kN"
  - "202.5 kN"
  - "1012.5 kN"
  - "506.25 kN"
  correct_answer: "1012.5 kN"
  explanation: "Pressure difference ΔP = ½ρ(v_top² - v_bottom²) = ½(0.9)(250² - 200²) = 0.45(62500 - 40000) = 0.45 × 22500 = 10125 Pa. Lift F = ΔP × A = 10125 × 100 = 1012500 N = 1012.5 kN. This is the basic principle of flight: shaped wing creates velocity difference, which creates pressure difference, generating upward lift. For a 100 metric ton plane, this lift must exceed 10⁶ N - which it does! Modern airplanes use this principle combined with angle of attack."
