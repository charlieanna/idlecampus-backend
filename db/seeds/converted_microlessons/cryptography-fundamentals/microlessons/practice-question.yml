    question: "When implementing TLS for a web application, which version should you use?"
    options:
      - "SSL 3.0 for maximum compatibility"
      - "TLS 1.0 for legacy support"
      - "TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 only, disabling older versions"
      - "Any version is fine as long as encryption is enabled"
    correct_answer: "TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 only, disabling older versions"
    explanation: "For modern web applications, you should configure servers to support only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, explicitly disabling SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1. All versions before TLS 1.2 have known security vulnerabilities and have been officially deprecated by standards bodies and major browsers. SSL 3.0 is vulnerable to POODLE attacks, while TLS 1.0 and 1.1 have various weaknesses including susceptibility to BEAST attacks and reliance on outdated cryptographic primitives. TLS 1.2 (from 2008) remains widely deployed and secure when properly configured with modern cipher suites. TLS 1.3 (from 2018) is the current recommended version, offering improved security through mandatory forward secrecy, removal of weak algorithms, simplified handshake, and reduced latency. All modern browsers and operating systems support TLS 1.2 and 1.3, so compatibility is not a concern for typical use cases. Server configuration should explicitly set minimum and maximum TLS versions, use strong cipher suites (preferring ECDHE for forward secrecy and AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 for encryption), and enable features like OCSP stapling. Regular testing with tools like SSL Labs helps ensure configuration remains secure as standards evolve."

    question: "What is the purpose of the Message Authentication Code (MAC) in TLS?"
    options:
      - "To encrypt the data"
      - "To verify data integrity and detect tampering"
      - "To authenticate the user"
      - "To compress the data"
    correct_answer: "To verify data integrity and detect tampering"
    explanation: "The Message Authentication Code (MAC) in TLS provides data integrity, ensuring that messages haven't been tampered with during transmission. While encryption provides confidentiality (preventing eavesdropping), it doesn't prevent tampering - an attacker could potentially modify ciphertext even without understanding it. The MAC is a cryptographic hash of the message combined with a secret key shared between client and server during the TLS handshake. The sender computes the MAC of each message before encrypting, sends both the encrypted data and the MAC, and the receiver verifies the MAC after decryption. If the MAC doesn't match, the message has been altered and is rejected. Modern TLS cipher suites often use authenticated encryption modes like AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305, which integrate encryption and authentication in a single operation, eliminating some classes of attacks possible with separate encrypt-then-MAC approaches. The MAC algorithm in TLS 1.2 might be HMAC with SHA-256 or SHA-384, depending on the cipher suite. This integrity protection is crucial for security - without it, attackers could perform bit-flipping attacks or inject malicious data, even without breaking the encryption. Together, encryption (confidentiality) and MAC (integrity) provide the foundation for secure communication."
