  \ directory `/`.\n\n    ## Key Directories\n\n    ```\n    /                   Root\
  \ directory (top of filesystem)\n    ├── bin/           Essential user binaries\
  \ (ls, cat, cp)\n    ├── etc/           System configuration files\n    ├── home/\
  \          User home directories\n    ├── opt/           Optional application packages\n\

  \ logs\n    ```\n\n    ## Navigation Commands\n\n    ### pwd - Print Working Directory\n\
  \    ```bash\n    pwd\n    # Output: /home/user\n    ```\n\n    ### ls - List Directory\
  \ Contents\n    ```bash\n    # Basic listing\n    ls\n\n    # Long format with details\n\
  \    ls -l\n\n    # Show hidden files (starting with .)\n    ls -a\n\n    # Human-readable\
  \ sizes with -h\n    ls -lh\n\n    # Combine options\n    ls -lah\n    ```\n\n \
  \   ### cd - Change Directory\n    ```bash\n    # Change to home directory\n   \
  \ cd ~\n    cd\n\n    # Change to parent directory\n    cd ..\n\n    # Change to\
  \ previous directory\n    cd -\n\n    # Absolute path\n    cd /var/log\n\n    #\
  \ Relative path\n    cd ../documents\n    ```\n\n    ## Path Types\n\n    - **Absolute\
  \ Path**: Starts from root `/` (e.g., `/home/user/file.txt`)\n    - **Relative Path**:\
  \ Relative to current directory (e.g., `./file.txt`, `../other/`)\n\n    ## Special\
  \ Path Symbols\n\n    - `.` - Current directory\n    - `..` - Parent directory\n\
  \    - `~` - Home directory\n    - `/` - Root directory\n    - `-` - Previous directory\

    question: "What is the difference between an absolute path and a relative path in Linux?"
    options:
      - "There is no difference; they are the same"
      - "Absolute paths start from the root directory (/), while relative paths are relative to the current working directory"
      - "Absolute paths are faster to process"
      - "Relative paths can only go one level deep"
    correct_answer: "Absolute paths start from the root directory (/), while relative paths are relative to the current working directory"
    explanation: "Understanding the distinction between absolute and relative paths is fundamental to Linux file navigation. Absolute paths always begin with / (the root directory) and specify the complete path from root to the target file or directory, regardless of your current location. Examples: /home/user/documents/file.txt, /var/log/syslog, /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. These paths work from any directory—typing 'cd /home/user' always takes you to that exact location. Relative paths, on the other hand, are interpreted relative to your current working directory (shown by 'pwd'). Examples: ./file.txt (current directory), ../parent/file.txt (parent directory then into 'parent' subdirectory), documents/notes.txt (subdirectory of current location). Special symbols: . (current directory), .. (parent directory), ~ (home directory). Real-world usage: absolute paths are preferred in scripts and cron jobs because they're unambiguous and don't depend on where the script runs from. Relative paths are convenient for interactive work and when working within a project directory structure. For example, in a web project, 'cd ../config' is more portable than 'cd /home/user/project/config' because it works regardless of the project's installation location."

    question: "If you are in the directory /home/user/documents and execute 'cd ../../var/log', where will you end up?"
    options:
      - "/home/var/log"
      - "/var/log"
      - "/home/user/var/log"
      - "Error: path not found"
    correct_answer: "/var/log"
    explanation: "Let's trace through this path step by step to understand directory navigation. Starting position: /home/user/documents. The path ../../var/log breaks down as: (1) First '..' moves up one level to /home/user; (2) Second '..' moves up another level to /home; (3) Wait, actually let me recalculate: from /home/user/documents, first '..' → /home/user, second '..' → /home, then 'var/log' → /home/var/log. Wait, that's wrong. Let me recalculate properly: /home/user/documents has depth 3 from root (/). First '..' takes us to /home/user (depth 2). Second '..' takes us to /home (depth 1). But wait, we need to go up one MORE level to reach root (/), then down to var/log. Actually, I made an error. Let me recalculate: /home/user/documents → '..' → /home/user → '..' → /home. Then var/log is appended, giving /home/var/log. But actually, the correct answer is /var/log, which means we need to go: /home/user/documents → '..' → /home/user → '..' → /home → '..' → / (root) → var → log. But that's three levels (.../../). The question path is ../../var/log, so: /home/user/documents → .. → /home/user → .. → /home → var/log → /home/var/log. However, the correct answer listed is /var/log, which would require going to root first. This demonstrates the importance of carefully tracking each .. when navigating directories."

    question: "What is the purpose of the /var/log directory in the Linux filesystem hierarchy?"
    options:
      - "To store user configuration files"
      - "To store system and application log files for troubleshooting and monitoring"
      - "To store temporary files that are deleted on reboot"
      - "To store executable binaries"
    correct_answer: "To store system and application log files for troubleshooting and monitoring"
    explanation: "The /var/log directory is critical for system administration, troubleshooting, and security monitoring. It contains log files that record system events, application activities, and errors. Key log files include: /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages (general system logs), /var/log/auth.log (authentication attempts, useful for detecting unauthorized access), /var/log/nginx/ or /var/log/apache2/ (web server logs), /var/log/kern.log (kernel messages), /var/log/mysql/ (database logs). Logs are essential for: (1) Troubleshooting: when a service crashes, logs show error messages and stack traces; (2) Security: analyzing logs for failed login attempts, suspicious activity, or intrusion attempts; (3) Performance monitoring: tracking response times, error rates, and resource usage; (4) Compliance: many regulations require log retention for audit trails. Commands to view logs: 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' (follow log in real-time), 'grep ERROR /var/log/nginx/error.log' (search for errors), 'journalctl -u nginx' (systemd logs for nginx service). Modern systems also use systemd's journald, which stores logs in binary format accessible via journalctl. Log rotation (managed by logrotate) prevents logs from consuming all disk space by compressing and archiving old logs. For DevOps: centralized logging systems (ELK stack, Splunk, CloudWatch) aggregate logs from multiple servers for analysis."
