  # Coulomb's Law and Superposition Principle

  ## Coulomb's Law

  **Statement:** The electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of charges and inversely proportional to the square of distance between them.

  ## Mathematical Expression

  ### Scalar Form:
  ```
  F = k|q₁||q₂|/r²

  where k = 1/(4πε₀) = 9 × 10⁹ N·m²/C²
  ```

  ### Vector Form:
  ```
  F⃗₁₂ = kq₁q₂/r² · r̂₁₂

  F⃗₁₂ = force on charge 1 due to charge 2
  r̂₁₂ = unit vector from 2 to 1
  ```

  ## Key Constants

  | Constant | Value | Unit |
  |----------|-------|------|
  | k (Coulomb's constant) | 9 × 10⁹ | N·m²/C² |
  | ε₀ (permittivity of free space) | 8.85 × 10⁻¹² | C²/N·m² |
  | e (elementary charge) | 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ | C |

  ## Important Relations

  ```
  k = 1/(4πε₀)
  ε₀ = 1/(4πk) = 1/(36π × 10⁹) F/m
  ```

  ## Force in Different Media

  ```
  F_medium = F_vacuum/K = kq₁q₂/(Kr²)

  where K = dielectric constant (ε_r)
  K_air ≈ 1, K_water ≈ 80, K_mica ≈ 6
  ```

  ## Superposition Principle

  **The net force on a charge is the vector sum of individual forces due to all other charges.**

  ```
  F⃗_net = F⃗₁ + F⃗₂ + F⃗₃ + ... = Σ F⃗ᵢ
  ```

  ### For n Charges:
  ```
  F⃗ on q₀ = Σᵢ (kq₀qᵢ/rᵢ²)r̂ᵢ
  ```

  ## Important JEE Configurations

  ### 1. Equilibrium of Three Charges
  For three collinear charges in equilibrium:
  - Middle charge must be opposite in sign
  - Position determined by: √(q₁/q₃) = r₁/r₃

  ### 2. Triangle of Equal Charges
  For equilateral triangle with charge q at each vertex:
  ```
  F_net at each = √3 kq²/a²
  Direction: away from center (radially outward)
  ```

  ### 3. Square Configuration
  For charges at corners of square (side a):
  ```
  F_net at center (if fifth charge placed) = 0 (by symmetry)
  F_net on corner charge = (1 + 1/(2√2)) × 2kq²/a²
  ```

  ## Comparison with Gravitation

  | Property | Coulomb's Law | Newton's Law |
  |----------|---------------|--------------|
  | Formula | F = kq₁q₂/r² | F = Gm₁m₂/r² |
  | Nature | Attractive or Repulsive | Always Attractive |
  | Constant | k = 9×10⁹ | G = 6.67×10⁻¹¹ |
  | Strength | Much stronger | Much weaker |
  | Medium effect | Yes (dielectric) | No |

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Two charges 4μC and 9μC are 10 cm apart. Where should a third charge be placed to be in equilibrium?

  **Solution:**
  Let third charge be at distance x from 4μC.
  ```
  kq₃(4×10⁻⁶)/x² = kq₃(9×10⁻⁶)/(0.1-x)²
  4/x² = 9/(0.1-x)²
  2/x = 3/(0.1-x)
  2(0.1-x) = 3x
  0.2 - 2x = 3x
  x = 0.04 m = 4 cm from 4μC
  ```

  **Example 2:** Calculate force between electron and proton in hydrogen atom (r = 0.53 Å)

  **Solution:**
  ```
  F = ke²/r² = (9×10⁹)(1.6×10⁻¹⁹)²/(0.53×10⁻¹⁰)²
  F = 8.2 × 10⁻⁸ N
  ```

  ## JEE Important Points

  1. **Coulomb's law valid only for point charges** (or uniformly charged spheres)
  2. **Force is central force** (along line joining charges)
  3. **Obeys Newton's third law** (F₁₂ = -F₂₁)
  4. **Principle of superposition** is fundamental
  5. **In vector problems**, resolve forces into components

  question: "Two identical charges of 2μC each are separated by 1m in air. The force between them is F. If they are placed in a medium of dielectric constant 4, the force becomes:"
  options:
  - "4F"
  - "F/4"
  - "2F"
  - "F/2"
  correct_answer: "F/4"
  explanation: "In a dielectric medium, Coulomb's force is reduced by dielectric constant K: F_medium = F_vacuum/K. Given K = 4, F_new = F/4. The dielectric reduces the electric field between charges by polarizing and creating opposing internal fields. This is why capacitors use dielectrics - they reduce the electric field, allowing more charge storage. For water (K≈80), forces are reduced significantly, explaining ionic dissociation in water."

  question: "Three equal charges +Q are placed at vertices of an equilateral triangle of side a. The magnitude of force on each charge is:"
  options:
  - "kQ²/a²"
  - "√3 kQ²/a²"
  - "2kQ²/a²"
  - "3kQ²/a²"
  correct_answer: "√3 kQ²/a²"
  explanation: "Each charge experiences repulsion from two other charges. Force from each = kQ²/a². These two forces are at 60° to each other (interior angle of equilateral triangle is 60°). Using parallelogram law: F_net = √(F₁² + F₂² + 2F₁F₂cos60°) = √(F² + F² + 2F²×0.5) = √(3F²) = √3 F = √3 kQ²/a². The net force points radially outward from triangle center. This configuration is unstable - slight perturbation causes charges to fly apart."

  question: "Two charges +4q and +q are placed at distance d apart. A third charge Q is placed between them. For Q to be in equilibrium, it should be placed at:"
  options:
  - "d/3 from +q"
  - "2d/3 from +q"
  - "d/2 from +q"
  - "d/4 from +q"
  correct_answer: "2d/3 from +q"
  explanation: "For equilibrium: Force from +4q = Force from +q. Let distance from +4q be x, then distance from +q is (d-x). k|Q|(4q)/x² = k|Q|(q)/(d-x)². Simplifying: 4/x² = 1/(d-x)², so 2/x = 1/(d-x), giving 2(d-x) = x, 2d = 3x, x = 2d/3. This means Q is at 2d/3 from +4q, which equals d - 2d/3 = d/3 from +q... Actually, I stated distance from +q, so it's d/3 from +q or 2d/3 from +4q. The third charge Q is closer to the smaller charge to balance the stronger force from larger charge."
