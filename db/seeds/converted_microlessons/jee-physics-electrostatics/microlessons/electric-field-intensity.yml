  # Electric Field Intensity and Field Lines

  ## Electric Field Concept

  **Region around a charge where other charges experience force.**

  ### Definition:
  ```
  E = F/q₀ (force per unit positive test charge)

  Unit: N/C = V/m
  ```

  ### Vector quantity:
  - Direction: Force on positive test charge
  - Magnitude: Force per unit charge

  ## Electric Field Due to Point Charge

  ```
  E = kQ/r² = Q/(4πε₀r²)

  Direction: Radially outward for +Q
             Radially inward for -Q
  ```

  ### Properties:
  - E ∝ Q (charge)
  - E ∝ 1/r² (inverse square law)
  - Independent of test charge q₀

  ## Electric Field Lines (Lines of Force)

  ### Properties:
  1. **Start from + charge, end at - charge** (or infinity)
  2. **Tangent gives direction** of E at that point
  3. **Density of lines ∝ E magnitude**
  4. **Never cross** each other
  5. **Continuous curves** (except at charges)
  6. **Perpendicular to equipotential** surfaces

  ### Patterns:
  - Isolated + charge: Radial outward lines
  - Isolated - charge: Radial inward lines
  - + and - charges: Lines from + to -
  - Two + charges: Lines repel, spread apart
  - Two - charges: Lines repel, spread apart

  ## Superposition of Electric Fields

  ```
  E_net = E₁ + E₂ + E₃ + ... (vector sum)
  ```

  Total field is vector sum of individual fields.

  ## Field on Axis of Dipole

  ```
  E_axial = 2kp/r³ = p/(2πε₀r³)

  p = qd = dipole moment
  Direction: Along dipole axis (+ to -)
  ```

  ## Field on Equatorial Line of Dipole

  ```
  E_equatorial = kp/r³ = p/(4πε₀r³)

  Direction: Opposite to dipole moment (- to +)
  ```

  Note: E_axial = 2 × E_equatorial (at same distance)

  ## Continuous Charge Distributions

  ### Linear Charge (λ C/m):
  ```
  dE = k(λ dl)/r²

  Infinite line: E = 2kλ/r = λ/(2πε₀r)
  Direction: Perpendicular to wire (radial)
  ```

  ### Surface Charge (σ C/m²):
  ```
  Infinite plane: E = σ/(2ε₀)

  Direction: Perpendicular to surface
  Independent of distance!
  ```

  ### Volume Charge (ρ C/m³):
  ```
  Inside sphere: E = kρr/3 = ρr/(3ε₀)
  Outside sphere: E = kQ/r² (point charge)
  ```

  ## Electric Field Due to Ring

  On axis at distance x:
  ```
  E = kQx/(R² + x²)^(3/2)

  Direction: Along axis
  Maximum at x = R/√2
  At center (x=0): E = 0
  ```

  ## Electric Field Due to Disc

  On axis:
  ```
  E = (σ/2ε₀)[1 - x/√(R² + x²)]

  As R → ∞: E = σ/(2ε₀) (infinite plane)
  At center (x=0, close): E ≈ σ/(2ε₀)
  ```

  ## Motion of Charge in Uniform Field

  ```
  Force F = qE (constant)
  Acceleration a = qE/m (constant)
  ```

  Like projectile in gravity, but horizontal acceleration.

  ### Deflection:
  ```
  y = ½at² = qEt²/(2m) = qEx²/(2mv₀²)

  Parabolic path!
  ```

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Electric field at 0.3 m from 2 μC charge?

  **Solution:**
  ```
  E = kQ/r² = (9×10⁹)(2×10⁻⁶)/(0.3)²
  E = 18×10³/0.09 = 2×10⁵ N/C = 200 kN/C

  Very strong field near charge!
  ```

  **Example 2:** Two charges +4 μC and -2 μC are 0.6 m apart. Find field at midpoint.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  Distance from each = 0.3 m
  E₁ = k(4×10⁻⁶)/(0.3)² = 4×10⁵ N/C (away from +)
  E₂ = k(2×10⁻⁶)/(0.3)² = 2×10⁵ N/C (toward -)

  Both fields point in same direction (toward -)
  E_net = 4×10⁵ + 2×10⁵ = 6×10⁵ N/C
  ```

  **Example 3:** Infinite line charge λ = 2 μC/m. Field at 0.1 m?

  **Solution:**
  ```
  E = 2kλ/r = 2(9×10⁹)(2×10⁻⁶)/(0.1)
  E = 36×10³/0.1 = 3.6×10⁵ N/C

  Note: E ∝ 1/r (not 1/r²) for line charge.
  ```

  ## JEE Key Points

  1. **E = kQ/r²** (point charge)
  2. **Field lines:** + to -, never cross
  3. **E_axial = 2kp/r³** (dipole)
  4. **Infinite plane: E = σ/(2ε₀)** (constant!)
  5. **Superposition:** Vector addition
  6. **E ⊥ equipotential surfaces**

  question: "Electric field at distance r from infinite line charge (λ C/m) is proportional to:"
  options:
  - "1/r"
  - "1/r²"
  - "r"
  - "r²"
  correct_answer: "1/r"
  explanation: "For infinite line charge: E = 2kλ/r = λ/(2πε₀r), so E ∝ 1/r. This is different from point charge (E ∝ 1/r²) and infinite plane (E = constant). The reason: line charge is 1D distribution. As you move away, more charges contribute to field (longer effective length visible), partially compensating for 1/r² decrease from each element. Result: 1/r dependence. For plane (2D), compensation is complete, giving constant E. This pattern: point (0D) → 1/r², line (1D) → 1/r, plane (2D) → constant. Important for electrostatics problems."

  question: "Two point charges +q and -q are placed at distance d apart. Electric field at point equidistant from both charges (on perpendicular bisector):"
  options:
  - "Zero"
  - "Parallel to line joining charges"
  - "Perpendicular to line joining charges"
  - "Makes 45° angle"
  correct_answer: "Parallel to line joining charges"
  explanation: "This forms a dipole. At equidistant point on perpendicular bisector: E₁ from +q points away from +q (radially), E₂ from -q points toward -q (radially). Magnitudes are equal (same distance from both charges). Adding vectors: components perpendicular to dipole axis cancel, components parallel add up. Net field is parallel to dipole axis, pointing from + to - (which is actually opposite to dipole moment vector). Magnitude: E = kp/r³ where r is distance from center. This analysis shows why equatorial field direction is opposite to axial field direction."

  question: "A charged particle enters uniform electric field perpendicular to field lines with velocity v. Path is:"
  options:
  - "Straight line"
  - "Circle"
  - "Parabola"
  - "Helix"
  correct_answer: "Parabola"
  explanation: "Uniform E means constant force F = qE (constant acceleration). Initial velocity perpendicular to field → like projectile motion in gravity. Horizontal: uniform motion (no force). Vertical: uniformly accelerated motion. Result: parabolic path! Equation: y = qEx²/(2mv²). This is exactly like ball thrown horizontally in Earth's gravity. Compare: In magnetic field, path is circular (force always perpendicular to velocity). In non-uniform electric field, path could be more complex. If initial velocity is parallel to E: straight line with acceleration. If at angle: still parabolic but inclined. This principle is used in cathode ray tubes, particle accelerators."
