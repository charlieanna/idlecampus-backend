  # Gauss's Law and Applications

  ## Electric Flux

  **Definition:** Electric flux through a surface is the number of electric field lines passing through it.

  ```
  Φ = E⃗ · A⃗ = EA cos θ (for uniform field)

  Φ = ∫E⃗ · dA⃗ (for non-uniform field)
  ```

  ### Properties:
  - Scalar quantity
  - SI unit: N·m²/C or V·m
  - Positive if field lines exit surface
  - Negative if field lines enter surface

  ## Gauss's Law Statement

  **"The total electric flux through any closed surface equals the net charge enclosed divided by ε₀."**

  ```
  ∮E⃗ · dA⃗ = Q_enclosed/ε₀

  or

  Φ = Q_enc/ε₀
  ```

  ## Key Concepts

  ### 1. Gaussian Surface
  - Imaginary closed surface
  - Chosen for mathematical convenience
  - Shape depends on charge distribution symmetry
  - Common shapes: sphere, cylinder, pillbox

  ### 2. Charge Enclosed
  - Only charges INSIDE the surface matter
  - External charges create no net flux
  - Internal fields from external charges cancel

  ### 3. Symmetry Requirements
  For Gauss's law to be useful:
  - E⃗ parallel to dA⃗ everywhere (or perpendicular)
  - |E⃗| constant on the surface
  - This requires high symmetry

  ## Applications

  ### 1. Point Charge
  **Gaussian surface:** Sphere of radius r centered on charge

  ```
  ∮E⃗ · dA⃗ = E(4πr²) = Q/ε₀

  E = Q/(4πε₀r²) = kQ/r² ✓
  ```

  Confirms Coulomb's law!

  ### 2. Infinite Line Charge (λ C/m)
  **Gaussian surface:** Cylinder of radius r, length L

  ```
  Flux through curved surface only:
  E(2πrL) = λL/ε₀

  E = λ/(2πε₀r) = 2kλ/r
  ```

  Field radially outward, inversely proportional to r.

  ### 3. Infinite Plane Sheet (σ C/m²)
  **Gaussian surface:** Pillbox (cylinder perpendicular to plane)

  ```
  Flux through two end faces:
  2EA = σA/ε₀

  E = σ/(2ε₀)
  ```

  Field is **uniform** - independent of distance!

  ### 4. Two Parallel Plates (Capacitor)
  ```
  Between plates: E = σ/ε₀
  Outside plates: E = 0

  (Superposition: Fields add between, cancel outside)
  ```

  ### 5. Uniformly Charged Sphere

  **Outside (r > R):**
  ```
  E = kQ/r² (acts like point charge at center)
  ```

  **Inside (r < R):**
  ```
  Q_enc = Q(r/R)³
  E = kQr/R³ = ρr/(3ε₀)

  E ∝ r (increases linearly)
  ```

  ### 6. Conducting Sphere (Charged)

  **Inside conductor:** E = 0 (always)
  **On surface:** E = σ/ε₀
  **Outside:** E = kQ/r²

  All charge resides on surface!

  ### 7. Spherical Shell

  **Outside (r > R):** E = kQ/r²
  **Inside (r < R):** E = 0

  No field inside hollow conductor!

  ## Important Results Table

  | Distribution | Gaussian Surface | Electric Field |
  |--------------|-----------------|----------------|
  | Point charge | Sphere | kQ/r² |
  | Line charge | Cylinder | λ/(2πε₀r) |
  | Plane sheet | Pillbox | σ/(2ε₀) |
  | Solid sphere (inside) | Sphere | kQr/R³ |
  | Solid sphere (outside) | Sphere | kQ/r² |
  | Shell (inside) | Sphere | 0 |
  | Shell (outside) | Sphere | kQ/r² |

  ## Flux Through Surfaces

  ### Closed Surface Around Charge:
  ```
  Φ = Q/ε₀ (regardless of surface shape)
  ```

  ### Flux Through Hemisphere (charge at center):
  ```
  Φ = Q/(2ε₀) (half of total)
  ```

  ### Flux Through Cube Face (charge at center):
  ```
  Φ = Q/(6ε₀) (one-sixth of total)
  ```

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Find electric field at r = 2 cm from infinite line with λ = 10⁻⁹ C/m.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  E = λ/(2πε₀r) = 2kλ/r
  E = 2(9×10⁹)(10⁻⁹)/(0.02)
  E = 18/0.02 = 900 N/C
  ```

  **Example 2:** A sphere of radius 10 cm has uniform charge Q = 1μC. Find E at r = 5 cm and r = 20 cm.

  **Solution:**
  Inside (r = 5 cm):
  ```
  E = kQr/R³ = (9×10⁹)(10⁻⁶)(0.05)/(0.1)³
  E = 450/0.001 = 4.5×10⁵ N/C
  ```

  Outside (r = 20 cm):
  ```
  E = kQ/r² = (9×10⁹)(10⁻⁶)/(0.2)²
  E = 9000/0.04 = 2.25×10⁵ N/C
  ```

  ## JEE Key Points

  1. **Gauss's law is always true**, but only useful with symmetry
  2. **Flux depends only on enclosed charge**, not field configuration
  3. **E = 0 inside conductor** in electrostatic equilibrium
  4. **Choose Gaussian surface wisely** - exploit symmetry
  5. **External charges don't contribute** to net flux

  question: "A point charge Q is placed at the center of a cube of side a. The electric flux through one face is:"
  options:
  - "Q/ε₀"
  - "Q/(6ε₀)"
  - "Q/(4ε₀)"
  - "Q/(8ε₀)"
  correct_answer: "Q/(6ε₀)"
  explanation: "By Gauss's law, total flux through closed surface = Q/ε₀. Cube has 6 identical faces, and by symmetry, flux is equally distributed. So flux through one face = Q/(6ε₀). This is true regardless of face size - if you change cube size, flux per face remains Q/(6ε₀) because larger area compensates for smaller field strength. This symmetry argument is powerful for JEE problems. Note: This only works when charge is at exact center."

  question: "Electric field inside a uniformly charged conducting sphere is:"
  options:
  - "Zero"
  - "Maximum at center"
  - "Proportional to distance from center"
  - "Inversely proportional to square of distance"
  correct_answer: "Zero"
  explanation: "Inside any conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, E = 0. This is because: (1) In equilibrium, charges don't move, so no net force, (2) Charges redistribute on surface until internal field is zero, (3) By Gauss's law with Gaussian surface inside: no charge enclosed (all on surface), so E = 0. This is different from uniformly charged non-conducting sphere where E ∝ r inside. The distinction between conducting and non-conducting is crucial in JEE. Conductors have surface charges; insulators can have volume charges."

  question: "Two infinite parallel plates have surface charge densities +σ and -σ. Electric field between them is:"
  options:
  - "Zero"
  - "σ/ε₀"
  - "σ/(2ε₀)"
  - "2σ/ε₀"
  correct_answer: "σ/ε₀"
  explanation: "Each plate produces field σ/(2ε₀) on both sides. Between plates: Fields from both plates point in same direction (from + to -). E_net = σ/(2ε₀) + σ/(2ε₀) = σ/ε₀. Outside plates: Fields point in opposite directions and cancel, E = 0. This is the principle of parallel plate capacitor. The field is uniform between plates, independent of position. Energy stored = ε₀E²/2 per unit volume. Note: If plates have same sign charge, field between them cancels and exists outside."
