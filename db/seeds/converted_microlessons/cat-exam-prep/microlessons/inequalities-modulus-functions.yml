  # Inequalities & Modulus Functions

  Master inequality manipulation and absolute value problems for CAT.

  ## Linear Inequalities

  ### Basic Rules

  1. **Addition/Subtraction:** Inequality preserved
     - a < b → a + c < b + c

  2. **Multiplication/Division by positive:** Inequality preserved
     - a < b and c > 0 → ac < bc

  3. **Multiplication/Division by negative:** Inequality reverses
     - a < b and c < 0 → ac > bc

  ## Quadratic Inequalities

  ### Method
  1. Solve as equation to find roots
  2. Place roots on number line
  3. Check sign in each interval
  4. Determine solution region

  **Example:** x² - 5x + 6 < 0
  - Roots: x = 2, x = 3
  - Solution: 2 < x < 3

  ### Sign Rules
  - (x-a)(x-b) > 0: x < a or x > b
  - (x-a)(x-b) < 0: a < x < b (when a < b)

  ## Modulus (Absolute Value)

  ### Definition
  |x| = x if x ≥ 0
  |x| = -x if x < 0

  ### Key Properties
  1. |x| ≥ 0 always
  2. |ab| = |a| × |b|
  3. |a/b| = |a|/|b|
  4. |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b| (Triangle Inequality)

  ### Solving Modulus Equations

  **|x| = a (where a > 0):**
  x = a or x = -a

  **|x - a| = b:**
  x = a + b or x = a - b

  ### Solving Modulus Inequalities

  **|x| < a (a > 0):**
  -a < x < a

  **|x| > a (a > 0):**
  x < -a or x > a

  **|x - a| < b:**
  a - b < x < a + b

  ## Practice Problems

  ### 1. Linear Inequality
  Solve: 3x - 7 > 2x + 5
  Solution: x > 12

  ### 2. Quadratic Inequality
  Solve: x² - 4x - 5 ≥ 0
  Factoring: (x-5)(x+1) ≥ 0
  Solution: x ≤ -1 or x ≥ 5

  ### 3. Modulus Equation
  Solve: |2x - 3| = 7
  x = 5 or x = -2

  ### 4. Modulus Inequality
  Solve: |x - 4| < 3
  Solution: 1 < x < 7

  question: Solve 3x - 7 > 2x + 5
  options:
  - 'x > 10'
  - 'x > 12'
  - 'x < 12'
  - 'x > 2'
  correct_answer: 'x > 12'
  explanation: "3x - 2x > 5 + 7, so x > 12"
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 2
  question: Solve |2x - 3| = 7
  options:
  - 'x = 5 only'
  - 'x = -2 only'
  - 'x = 5 or x = -2'
  - 'x = 2 or x = -5'
  correct_answer: 'x = 5 or x = -2'
  explanation: "2x-3=7 gives x=5. 2x-3=-7 gives x=-2."
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 3
  question: Solve |x - 4| < 3
  options:
  - 'x < 7'
  - 'x > 1'
  - '1 < x < 7'
  - 'x < 1 or x > 7'
  correct_answer: '1 < x < 7'
  explanation: "|x-4| < 3 means -3 < x-4 < 3, so 1 < x < 7"
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 4
  question: When multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number:
  options:
  - 'Inequality sign stays same'
  - 'Inequality sign reverses'
  - 'Inequality becomes equation'
  - 'Result is undefined'
  correct_answer: 'Inequality sign reverses'
  explanation: "Multiplying/dividing by negative reverses the inequality direction."

  question: Solve x² - 4x - 5 ≥ 0
  options:
  - '-1 ≤ x ≤ 5'
  - 'x ≤ -1 or x ≥ 5'
  - 'x < -1 or x > 5'
  - '-5 ≤ x ≤ 1'
  correct_answer: 'x ≤ -1 or x ≥ 5'
  explanation: "(x-5)(x+1) ≥ 0. Roots are -1 and 5. Parabola opens up, so solution is outside roots."
