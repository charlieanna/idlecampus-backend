  # Time, Speed & Distance

  Master motion problems - one of the most frequent CAT topics with diverse applications.

  ## Overview

  **Module:** Quantitative Aptitude
  **Topic:** Time, Speed & Distance
  **CAT Weightage:** 12-18% of QA section
  **Difficulty Range:** Medium to Hard

  ---

  ## Core Concepts

  ### Basic Relationship

  **Speed = Distance / Time**
  **Distance = Speed × Time**
  **Time = Distance / Speed**

  ### Unit Conversions

  **km/hr to m/s:** Multiply by 5/18
  **m/s to km/hr:** Multiply by 18/5

  Example: 72 km/hr = 72 × 5/18 = 20 m/s

  ### Average Speed

  **For same distance at different speeds:**
  Average Speed = 2S₁S₂/(S₁ + S₂)

  **For same time at different speeds:**
  Average Speed = (S₁ + S₂)/2

  **General:**
  Average Speed = Total Distance/Total Time

  ---

  ## Types of Problems

  ### 1. Relative Speed

  **Same Direction:**
  Relative Speed = |S₁ - S₂|

  **Opposite Direction:**
  Relative Speed = S₁ + S₂

  **Applications:**
  - Trains crossing each other
  - Boats and streams
  - Races and competitions

  ### 2. Trains

  **Crossing a Stationary Object:**
  Time = Length of Train / Speed of Train

  **Crossing a Platform/Bridge:**
  Time = (Length of Train + Length of Platform) / Speed

  **Two Trains Crossing:**
  Time = (L₁ + L₂) / Relative Speed

  ### 3. Boats and Streams

  **Downstream (with stream):** Speed = B + S
  **Upstream (against stream):** Speed = B - S

  Where B = Speed of boat in still water
        S = Speed of stream

  **Speed of Boat:** B = (Downstream + Upstream)/2
  **Speed of Stream:** S = (Downstream - Upstream)/2

  ### 4. Circular Motion

  **First Meeting Time:**
  - Same Direction: Length/(|S₁ - S₂|)
  - Opposite Direction: Length/(S₁ + S₂)

  ## Problem-Solving Patterns

  ### Pattern 1: Distance Constant
  ```
  Problem: A travels at 40 km/hr and B at 60 km/hr.
  B starts 2 hours after A. When does B catch A?

  Solution:
  A's head start = 40 × 2 = 80 km
  Relative speed = 60 - 40 = 20 km/hr
  Time for B to catch = 80/20 = 4 hours
  Total time from A's start = 6 hours
  ```

  ### Pattern 2: Meeting Point
  ```
  Problem: A and B start from opposite ends of 100 km path.
  Speeds are 20 and 30 km/hr. Where do they meet?

  Solution:
  Combined speed = 50 km/hr
  Meeting time = 100/50 = 2 hours
  A covers = 20 × 2 = 40 km from start
  ```

  ### Pattern 3: Late/Early Arrival
  ```
  Problem: Walking at 5 km/hr, person is 10 min late.
  At 6 km/hr, reaches 10 min early. Find distance.

  Solution:
  Difference in time = 20 min = 1/3 hour
  D/5 - D/6 = 1/3
  D/30 = 1/3
  D = 10 km
  ```

  ## CAT-Specific Strategies

  ### Shortcut Formulas

  1. **If speed changes from S to kS, time becomes T/k**

  2. **Races:**
     - A beats B by d meters in L meter race
     - A's speed : B's speed = L : (L-d)

  3. **Clocks:**
     - Minute hand gains 5.5° per minute over hour hand
     - Overlap every 65 5/11 minutes

  ### Mental Math Tips

  - 36 km/hr = 10 m/s
  - 54 km/hr = 15 m/s
  - 72 km/hr = 20 m/s
  - 90 km/hr = 25 m/s

  ## Key Takeaways

  - Always check and convert units first
  - Relative speed simplifies two-body motion problems
  - Average speed for same distance uses harmonic mean
  - Train problems need total length calculation
  - Draw diagrams for complex motion scenarios
