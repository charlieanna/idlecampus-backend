  ## Core Concepts

  ### Ratio Basics

  **Definition:** A ratio compares two quantities by division
  - Written as a:b or a/b
  - Order matters: a:b ≠ b:a (unless a = b)
  - Ratios are dimensionless

  **Properties:**
  - a:b = ka:kb (multiplying by same number)
  - a:b = a/k : b/k (dividing by same number)
  - If a:b = c:d, then ad = bc (cross multiplication)

  **Types:**
  - **Duplicate Ratio:** a²:b²
  - **Sub-duplicate Ratio:** √a:√b
  - **Triplicate Ratio:** a³:b³
  - **Inverse Ratio:** b:a

  ### Proportion

  **Definition:** Equality of two ratios
  a:b = c:d or a/b = c/d

  **Key Properties:**
  - **Componendo:** (a+b)/b = (c+d)/d
  - **Dividendo:** (a-b)/b = (c-d)/d
  - **Componendo-Dividendo:** (a+b)/(a-b) = (c+d)/(c-d)
  - **Alternendo:** a/c = b/d
  - **Invertendo:** b/a = d/c

  **Mean Proportional:**
  If a:x = x:b, then x = √(ab) is the mean proportional

  **Third Proportional:**
  If a:b = b:c, then c is the third proportional
  c = b²/a

  ## Variation

  ### Direct Variation
  If x ∝ y, then x = ky (k is constant)
  - x increases → y increases
  - x₁/y₁ = x₂/y₂

  ### Inverse Variation
  If x ∝ 1/y, then xy = k (constant)
  - x increases → y decreases
  - x₁y₁ = x₂y₂

  ### Joint Variation
  If z ∝ xy, then z = kxy
  If z ∝ x/y, then z = kx/y

  ## Problem-Solving Patterns

  ### Pattern 1: Finding Ratio from Equations
  ```
  Problem: If 3x = 4y = 5z, find x:y:z
  Solution:
  Let 3x = 4y = 5z = k
  x = k/3, y = k/4, z = k/5
  x:y:z = 1/3 : 1/4 : 1/5
  = 20:15:12 (multiply by LCM 60)
  ```

  ### Pattern 2: Partnership Problems
  ```
  Problem: A and B invest in ratio 2:3. A's investment time is twice B's.
  Find profit sharing ratio.

  Solution:
  Profit ratio = (Capital × Time) ratio
  = (2 × 2t) : (3 × t) = 4:3
  ```

  ### Pattern 3: Mixture Problems
  ```
  Problem: Mixing two alloys with gold ratio 2:5 and 3:7
  In what ratio to get alloy with gold ratio 1:2?

  Solution:
  Alloy 1: Gold = 2/7
  Alloy 2: Gold = 3/10
  Desired: Gold = 1/3

  Using alligation:
  Alloy1 : Alloy2 = (3/10 - 1/3) : (1/3 - 2/7)
  ```

  ## CAT-Specific Strategies

  ### Quick Calculations
  1. **If ratio is a:b:c and sum is S:**
     - First quantity = (a/(a+b+c)) × S

  2. **If ratio changes from a:b to c:d:**
     - Use the constant quantity to find relationship

  3. **Income:Expense:Savings problems:**
     - Savings = Income - Expense
     - Set up ratio equations carefully

  ## Key Takeaways

  - Ratios express relative magnitudes, proportions express equality
  - Variation problems follow specific mathematical relationships
  - Partnership uses Capital × Time principle
  - Componendo-Dividendo is powerful for ratio manipulation
  - Mixture problems often need alligation approach

  question: If a:b = 2:3 and b:c = 4:5, find a:b:c
  options:
  - '8:12:15'
  - '2:3:5'
  - '4:6:5'
  - '8:12:10'
  correct_answer: '8:12:15'
  explanation: "Make b common: a:b = 8:12, b:c = 12:15. So a:b:c = 8:12:15"

  question: A starts business with Rs. 5000. B joins after 3 months with Rs. 6000. In what ratio should they share yearly profit?
  options:
  - '10:9'
  - '5:6'
