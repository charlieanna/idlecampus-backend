  # Tables & Data Analysis

  Master data interpretation from tables - extract insights quickly and accurately.

  ---

  ## Overview

  **Module:** Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning
  **Topic:** Table Analysis
  **CAT Weightage:** 20-25% of DILR section
  **Difficulty Range:** Easy to Hard

  ## Types of Data Tables

  ### Simple Tables

  Single variable relationships
  - Sales data over years
  - Population statistics
  - Production figures

  ### Multi-Variable Tables

  Multiple dimensions of data
  - Product-wise, Region-wise sales
  - Year-wise, Category-wise growth
  - Cross-tabulated information

  ### Incomplete Tables

  Missing data to be calculated
  - Requires logical deduction
  - Uses relationships between cells
  - CAT favorite type

  ## Core Calculation Skills

  ### Percentage Calculations

  **Growth Rate:**
  ((New - Old) / Old) × 100

  **Share/Proportion:**
  (Part / Total) × 100

  **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**
  [(Final/Initial)^(1/n) - 1] × 100

  ### Ratio Analysis

  **Comparing ratios across categories:**
  - Identify patterns
  - Find outliers
  - Track trends

  ### Average and Weighted Average

  **Simple Average:** Sum / Count

  **Weighted Average:** Σ(Value × Weight) / Σ(Weight)

  ## Problem-Solving Framework

  ### Step 1: Understand Table Structure

  - What are row headers?
  - What are column headers?
  - What units are used?
  - Are there totals/subtotals?

  ### Step 2: Quick Scan

  - Maximum/Minimum values
  - Obvious patterns
  - Missing data
  - Outliers

  ### Step 3: Read Questions First

  - Understand what's being asked
  - Identify relevant data
  - Plan calculation approach

  ### Step 4: Calculate Strategically

  - Approximate when possible
  - Use shortcuts
  - Verify logic

  ## CAT-Specific Strategies

  ### Mental Math Shortcuts

  **Percentage Approximations:**
  - 10% = divide by 10
  - 5% = half of 10%
  - 25% = divide by 4
  - 33.33% = divide by 3
  - 12.5% = divide by 8

  **Quick Division:**
  - Divide by 5 = multiply by 2, divide by 10
  - Divide by 25 = multiply by 4, divide by 100

  ### Comparison Without Full Calculation

  **Ratio Comparison:**
  Instead of calculating exact percentages, compare:
  a/b vs c/d
  Cross multiply: ad vs bc

  **Growth Comparison:**
  Look at absolute change relative to base, not exact percentage

  ## Common Question Types

  ### Type 1: Direct Reading
  "What was the sales in 2020?"
  - Read from table directly
  - Check units

  ### Type 2: Percentage Change
  "What was the growth rate from 2019 to 2020?"
  - Calculate: (2020-2019)/2019 × 100

  ### Type 3: Proportion
  "What percentage of total sales came from Product A?"
  - Calculate: Product A / Total × 100

  ### Type 4: Ranking
  "Which region had the highest growth?"
  - Calculate growth for each
  - Compare and rank

  ### Type 5: Multi-Step
  "If growth continues at same rate, what will be 2025 sales?"
  - Project using growth pattern
  - Apply formula consistently

  ## Sample Data Analysis

  **Sales Data (in Rs. Crores)**

  | Product | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
  |---------|------|------|------|------|------|
  | A       | 120  | 138  | 150  | 165  | 182  |
  | B       | 85   | 92   | 104  | 115  | 125  |
  | C       | 200  | 210  | 225  | 240  | 260  |
  | D       | 95   | 105  | 118  | 130  | 145  |
  | Total   | 500  | 545  | 597  | 650  | 712  |

  **Analysis Examples:**
  - Growth of A from 2018-2019: (138-120)/120 × 100 = 15%
  - Market share of C in 2022: 260/712 × 100 ≈ 36.5%
  - CAGR of B (4 years): (125/85)^(1/4) - 1 ≈ 10%

  question: If sales grew from Rs. 200 crores to Rs. 250 crores, what is the percentage growth?
  options:
  - '25%'
  - '20%'
  - '30%'
  - '50%'
  correct_answer: '25%'
  explanation: "Growth = (250-200)/200 × 100 = 50/200 × 100 = 25%"

  options:
  - '25%'
  - '20%'
  - '30%'
  - '15%'
  correct_answer: '25%'
