  # Averages, Mixtures & Alligation

  Master weighted averages and mixture problems - essential for CAT quantitative section.

  ## Core Concepts

  ### Simple Average

  **Formula:** Average = Sum of values / Number of values

  **Properties:**
  - Sum = Average × Count
  - If all values equal to average, sum remains same
  - Average lies between minimum and maximum values

  ### Weighted Average

  **Formula:**
  Weighted Average = Σ(Value × Weight) / Σ(Weight)

  **Applications:**
  - Class average when sections have different sizes
  - Portfolio returns with different investments
  - Mixture problems

  ### Alligation Rule

  **Visual Method:**
  ```
    Cheaper -------- Mean -------- Dearer
             \              /
        (Dearer-Mean) : (Mean-Cheaper)
  ```

  **Formula:**
  Ratio = (Dearer - Mean) : (Mean - Cheaper)

  ## Important Formulas

  ### Change in Average

  **When one value changes:**
  New Average = Old Average + (Change in value / n)

  **When item added:**
  New Average = (Old Sum + New Item) / (n + 1)

  **When item removed:**
  New Average = (Old Sum - Removed Item) / (n - 1)

  ### Mixture Problems

  **Final Concentration:**
  C_final = (C₁V₁ + C₂V₂) / (V₁ + V₂)

  **Successive Replacement:**
  After n replacements of quantity x from vessel of capacity V:
  Final concentration = Initial × (1 - x/V)^n

  ## Practice Problems

  ### 1. Simple Average [Easy]
  The average of 5 numbers is 24. If one number is excluded, average becomes 23. Find excluded number.

  **Solution:**
  Sum of 5 numbers = 5 × 24 = 120
  Sum of 4 numbers = 4 × 23 = 92
  Excluded number = 120 - 92 = 28

  ### 2. Weighted Average [Medium]
  In a class of 30 boys and 20 girls, boys' average score is 65 and girls' is 75. Find class average.

  **Solution:**
  Weighted Average = (30×65 + 20×75) / 50
  = (1950 + 1500) / 50 = 69

  ### 3. Alligation [Medium]
  In what ratio should water be mixed with wine costing Rs. 60/liter to get mixture worth Rs. 40/liter?

  **Solution:**
  Water costs Rs. 0, Wine costs Rs. 60, Mean is Rs. 40
  Ratio = (60-40) : (40-0) = 20 : 40 = 1 : 2
  Water : Wine = 1 : 2

  ### 4. Successive Replacement [Hard]
  A vessel contains 60L milk. 12L is removed and replaced with water. This is done 3 times. Find milk remaining.

  **Solution:**
  Milk remaining = 60 × (1 - 12/60)³
  = 60 × (0.8)³ = 60 × 0.512 = 30.72L

  ## Key Takeaways

  - Alligation is powerful for mixture proportion problems
  - Weighted average accounts for relative importance
  - Successive replacement follows exponential decay
  - Average lies between extreme values
