  # Critical Reasoning & Logical Arguments

  Develop skills to analyze arguments, identify assumptions, and evaluate conclusions.

  ## Overview

  **Module:** Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension
  **Topic:** Critical Reasoning
  **CAT Weightage:** 5-10% of VARC section
  **Difficulty Range:** Medium to Hard

  ## Argument Structure

  ### Basic Components

  **Premise:** Facts or statements given as true
  **Conclusion:** What is being argued/claimed
  **Assumption:** Unstated premise that connects premise to conclusion

  **Example:**
  - Premise: All employees completed the training.
  - Premise: Training improves performance.
  - Assumption: The training was effective for all employees.
  - Conclusion: All employees will show improved performance.

  ## Types of CR Questions

  ### 1. Assumption Questions

  **Pattern:** "Which assumption does the argument depend on?"

  **Strategy:**
  - Identify premise and conclusion
  - Find the gap between them
  - The assumption bridges this gap

  **Test:** Negate the answer - if argument falls apart, it's the assumption

  ### 2. Strengthen Questions

  **Pattern:** "Which would most strengthen the argument?"

  **Strategy:**
  - Find conclusion
  - Look for evidence that supports it
  - Good answer adds credibility to conclusion

  ### 3. Weaken Questions

  **Pattern:** "Which would most weaken the argument?"

  **Strategy:**
  - Identify the reasoning
  - Find evidence that undermines conclusion
  - Look for alternative explanations or counterexamples

  ### 4. Inference Questions

  **Pattern:** "Which can be logically inferred?"

  **Strategy:**
  - Stick close to given information
  - Don't over-extend reasoning
  - Must be necessarily true

  ### 5. Flaw Questions

  **Pattern:** "The reasoning is flawed because..."

  **Strategy:**
  - Identify logical error
  - Common flaws: correlation/causation, hasty generalization, false dichotomy

  ## Common Logical Fallacies

  ### 1. Correlation vs Causation

  **Error:** Assuming A causes B just because they occur together

  **Example:**
  "Ice cream sales and drowning deaths both increase in summer. Therefore, ice cream causes drowning."

  **Reality:** Both caused by hot weather (confounding variable)

  ### 2. Hasty Generalization

  **Error:** Drawing broad conclusion from limited evidence

  **Example:**
  "I met two rude taxi drivers in City X. People in City X are rude."

  ### 3. False Dichotomy

  **Error:** Presenting only two options when more exist

  **Example:**
  "Either we cut the education budget or we go bankrupt."

  ### 4. Ad Hominem

  **Error:** Attacking person rather than argument

  **Example:**
  "You can't trust his economic analysis; he's never run a business."

  ### 5. Circular Reasoning

  **Error:** Conclusion is restated premise

  **Example:**
  "This is a good book because it's well-written, and well-written books are good."

  ### 6. Appeal to Authority

  **Error:** Using irrelevant authority as evidence

  **Example:**
  "This diet works because a famous actor recommends it."

  ## Problem-Solving Framework

  ### Step 1: Identify Argument Type

  - Causal reasoning?
  - Statistical argument?
  - Analogy-based?
  - Definition-based?

  ### Step 2: Map the Logic

  - What is stated (premises)?
  - What is concluded?
  - What is assumed?

  ### Step 3: Apply Question Type Strategy

  - For strengthen: Add supporting evidence
  - For weaken: Add contradicting evidence
  - For assumption: Find the bridge
  - For flaw: Identify the error

  ### Step 4: Eliminate Wrong Answers

  - Out of scope (introduces irrelevant information)
  - Opposite effect (strengthens when asked to weaken)
  - Too extreme (always, never, completely)
  - Premise restatement (doesn't add new information)

  ## Key Takeaways

  - Arguments have structure: premises, assumptions, conclusions
  - Different question types require different approaches
  - Logical fallacies appear frequently in CAT
  - Elimination is powerful for CR questions
  - Practice identifying assumptions - it's the most common question type

exercises:
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 1
  question: "Argument: 'Company X's profits increased after implementing flexible work hours. Therefore, flexible work hours boost profitability.' What assumption is made?"
  options:
  - 'Employees prefer flexible hours'
  - 'No other factors caused the profit increase'
  - 'The CEO supported the policy'
  - 'Competitors also use flexible hours'
  correct_answer: 'No other factors caused the profit increase'
  explanation: "The argument assumes causation from correlation. The key assumption is that nothing else (economic conditions, new products, etc.) caused the profit increase."
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 2
  question: Which logical fallacy is this? 'Either we ban all cars or accept pollution. There's no middle ground.'
  options:
  - 'Ad hominem'
  - 'False dichotomy'
  - 'Circular reasoning'
  - 'Hasty generalization'
  correct_answer: 'False dichotomy'
  explanation: "False dichotomy presents only two options when others exist (electric cars, emission standards, public transport, etc.)."
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 3
  question: To weaken an argument, you should find evidence that:
  options:
  - 'Supports the conclusion'
  - 'Restates the premise'
  - 'Undermines the conclusion or provides alternative explanation'
  - 'Changes the topic entirely'
  correct_answer: 'Undermines the conclusion or provides alternative explanation'
  explanation: "Weakening requires showing the conclusion doesn't follow from premises, often by providing counterexamples or alternative explanations."
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 4
  question: What is the 'negation test' used for?
  options:
  - 'Finding the conclusion'
  - 'Identifying premises'
  - 'Verifying if something is a necessary assumption'
  - 'Calculating probabilities'
  correct_answer: 'Verifying if something is a necessary assumption'
  explanation: "If negating a statement makes the argument fall apart, that statement is a necessary assumption of the argument."
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 5
  question: "'Studies show people who eat breakfast are healthier. Therefore, eating breakfast makes you healthy.' This is an example of:"
  options:
  - 'Valid causal reasoning'
  - 'Correlation mistaken for causation'
  - 'Circular reasoning'
  - 'Appeal to authority'
  correct_answer: 'Correlation mistaken for causation'
  explanation: "The argument assumes breakfast causes health, but the correlation might be due to other factors (healthy people tend to have regular habits including breakfast)."
  require_pass: true
