  **CAT Weightage:** 8-12% of QA section
  **Difficulty Range:** Easy to Hard

  ## Core Concepts

  ### Basic Work Principles

  **Fundamental Relationship:**
  - Work = Rate × Time
  - Rate = Work / Time
  - Time = Work / Rate

  **Efficiency Concept:**
  If A completes work in n days, A's daily work = 1/n

  **Combined Work:**
  If A does 1/a work per day and B does 1/b per day:
  Together: 1/a + 1/b = (a+b)/(ab) per day
  Time together = ab/(a+b)

  ### Important Formulas

  **Two Workers:**
  Time = (A × B)/(A + B) where A and B are individual times

  **Three Workers:**
  Time = (A × B × C)/(AB + BC + CA)

  **Efficiency Relationship:**
  If M₁ workers in D₁ days do W₁ work:
  M₁D₁/W₁ = M₂D₂/W₂

  Extended: M₁D₁H₁/W₁ = M₂D₂H₂/W₂
  (H = hours per day)

  ## Pipes and Cisterns

  ### Basic Concepts

  **Inlet Pipe:** Fills tank (positive work)
  **Outlet Pipe:** Empties tank (negative work)

  **Combined Rate:**
  - Two inlets: Add rates
  - Two outlets: Add rates (both negative)
  - Inlet + Outlet: Subtract rates

  ### Key Formulas

  **If pipe A fills in a hours and B empties in b hours:**
  - Both open: Time = ab/(b-a) [if b > a, fills]
  - Both open: Time = ab/(a-b) [if a > b, empties]

  ## Problem-Solving Patterns

  ### Pattern 1: LCM Method (Recommended)
  ```
  Problem: A does work in 20 days, B in 30 days. Together?

  Solution:
  Total work = LCM(20, 30) = 60 units
  A's rate = 60/20 = 3 units/day
  B's rate = 60/30 = 2 units/day
  Combined = 5 units/day
  Time = 60/5 = 12 days
  ```

  ### Pattern 2: Work Left Behind
  ```
  Problem: A and B start together. A leaves after 6 days,
  B finishes remaining in 8 days. A alone takes 12 days.
  Find B's time.

  Solution:
  Let B takes x days
  In 6 days: 6/12 + 6/x = part done
  B alone in 8 days: 8/x
  Total: 6/12 + 6/x + 8/x = 1
  1/2 + 14/x = 1
  x = 28 days
  ```

  ### Pattern 3: Alternate Working
  ```
  Problem: A and B take 12 and 15 days. If they work on
  alternate days starting with A, when is work done?

  Solution:
  Work = LCM(12,15) = 60 units
  A = 5 units/day, B = 4 units/day
  Two-day cycle = 9 units
  After 6 cycles (12 days) = 54 units
  Day 13 (A's turn): +5 units = 59 units
  Day 14 (B's turn): needs 1 unit, B does 4/day
  Time = 13 + 1/4 days
  ```

  ## CAT-Specific Strategies

  ### Efficiency Variations

  1. **If efficiency of A is x times B:**
     - A's time = B's time / x
     - A does x times more work per day

  2. **Wages Division:**
     - Wages proportional to work done
     - If work ratio is a:b:c, wages ratio is a:b:c

  3. **Men-Women-Children:**
     - Set up efficiency ratios
     - Common: 3M = 4W = 6C

  ## Key Takeaways

  - LCM method simplifies most work problems
  - Pipes follow same logic as work (inlet = positive, outlet = negative)
  - Efficiency is inversely proportional to time
  - Wages are distributed based on work contribution
  - Draw timeline for complex multi-worker scenarios

  question: A completes work in 10 days, B in 15 days. Working together, how many days to complete?
  options:
  - '6 days'
  - '5 days'
  - '8 days'
  - '7 days'
  correct_answer: '6 days'
  explanation: "Time together = 10×15/(10+15) = 150/25 = 6 days"

  question: Pipe A fills tank in 20 min, B in 30 min. Both open together, time to fill?
  options:
  - '12 minutes'
  - '15 minutes'
  - '10 minutes'
  - '18 minutes'
  correct_answer: '12 minutes'
  explanation: "Time = 20×30/(20+30) = 600/50 = 12 minutes"

  question: Pipe A fills in 10 hrs, B empties in 15 hrs. Both open, time to fill?
  options:
  - '30 hours'
  - '25 hours'
  - '20 hours'
  - '35 hours'
  correct_answer: '30 hours'
  explanation: "Net filling rate = 1/10 - 1/15 = 1/30. Time = 30 hours"

  question: A is twice as efficient as B. Together they finish in 12 days. How many days for A alone?
  options:
  - '18 days'
  - '24 days'
  - '36 days'
  - '15 days'
  correct_answer: '18 days'
  explanation: "If B takes x days, A takes x/2 days. (x/2)×x/(x/2+x) = 12. Solving: x/3 = 12, x = 36. A = 18 days"

  question: A and B together finish in 10 days. A alone in 15 days. Total wage Rs. 3000. What is A's share?
  options:
  - 'Rs. 2000'
  - 'Rs. 1500'
  - 'Rs. 1800'
