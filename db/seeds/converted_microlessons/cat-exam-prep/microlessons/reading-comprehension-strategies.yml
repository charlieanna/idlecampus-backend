  ## Reading Strategies

  ### Active Reading

  **DON'T:** Read passively like a story
  **DO:** Engage with the text

  **Mark while reading:**
  - Main idea of each paragraph
  - Key arguments
  - Examples and evidence
  - Transition words (however, therefore, despite)
  - Author's tone indicators

  ### Paragraph Analysis

  **For each paragraph, identify:**
  1. Topic sentence (usually first/second)
  2. Supporting details
  3. Purpose (introduce, argue, exemplify, conclude)
  4. Connection to previous paragraph

  ### Time Management

  **Recommended approach:**
  - Passage reading: 3-4 minutes (700-800 words)
  - Questions: 1-1.5 minutes each
  - Total per set: 8-10 minutes

  ## Question Types

  ### 1. Main Idea/Central Theme

  **Question patterns:**
  - "The passage is primarily about..."
  - "The central argument is..."
  - "Which best summarizes the passage?"

  **Strategy:**
  - Look at first and last paragraphs
  - Identify recurring themes
  - Avoid too narrow or too broad options

  ### 2. Inference Questions

  **Question patterns:**
  - "It can be inferred that..."
  - "The author implies..."
  - "Based on the passage, one can conclude..."

  **Strategy:**
  - Look for evidence in passage
  - Don't over-infer (stick close to text)
  - Eliminate impossible options first

  ### 3. Author's Tone/Attitude

  **Question patterns:**
  - "The author's tone is..."
  - "The author's attitude towards X is..."
  - "The passage conveys a sense of..."

  **Common tones:**
  - Objective/Neutral
  - Critical/Skeptical
  - Supportive/Appreciative
  - Concerned/Worried
  - Ironic/Satirical

  ### 4. Specific Detail Questions

  **Question patterns:**
  - "According to the passage..."
  - "The author mentions X to..."
  - "Which of the following is stated?"

  **Strategy:**
  - Locate exact reference in passage
  - Read surrounding context
  - Match with options carefully

  ### 5. Vocabulary in Context

  **Question patterns:**
  - "The word X as used in the passage means..."
  - "X most nearly means..."

  **Strategy:**
  - Read sentence with the word
  - Consider paragraph context
  - Substitute options and check fit

  ## Answer Elimination Techniques

  ### Red Flags in Wrong Options

  1. **Too extreme:** Always, never, completely, only
  2. **Out of scope:** Not mentioned in passage
  3. **Opposite meaning:** Contradicts passage
  4. **True but irrelevant:** Fact from passage but doesn't answer question
  5. **Partially correct:** Some part is wrong

  ### Choosing Between Close Options

  - Which has better passage evidence?
  - Which covers more of the question requirement?
  - Which doesn't add extra information?
