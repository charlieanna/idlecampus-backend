  # Bar Charts & Graphical Data Interpretation

  Master visual data analysis - critical for CAT DILR section.

  ---

  ## Types of Bar Charts

  ### Simple Bar Chart
  - Single data series
  - Easy comparison of values
  - Height represents magnitude

  ### Grouped Bar Chart
  - Multiple series side by side
  - Compare categories across groups
  - Common baseline

  ### Stacked Bar Chart
  - Series stacked on top
  - Shows composition and total
  - Requires careful reading

  ### Horizontal Bar Chart
  - Categories on Y-axis
  - Values on X-axis
  - Good for long category names

  ## Reading Strategies

  ### Quick Scan (30 seconds)
  1. Understand axes labels and units
  2. Note scale and intervals
  3. Identify maximum and minimum
  4. Spot obvious patterns

  ### Calculation Techniques

  **Percentage Change:**
  ((New - Old) / Old) × 100

  **Comparison:**
  - Visual estimation first
  - Calculate only when necessary
  - Use ratios for quick comparison

  **Trends:**
  - Increasing/Decreasing pattern
  - Cyclical patterns
  - Anomalies or outliers

  ## Common Question Types

  ### 1. Direct Reading
  "What was sales in 2020?"
  - Read directly from chart

  ### 2. Percentage Change
  "What was growth rate from 2019 to 2020?"
  - Calculate: (V₂-V₁)/V₁ × 100

  ### 3. Ranking
  "Which year had highest growth?"
  - Calculate growth for each
  - Compare and rank

  ### 4. Cumulative
  "What is total sales over 5 years?"
  - Add all values
  - Watch for units

  ### 5. Ratio Comparison
  "Which product has highest sales to cost ratio?"
  - Calculate ratio for each
  - Compare

  ## Practice Set

  **Sample Chart Data:**
  Company Revenue (Rs. Crores)
  - 2018: 150
  - 2019: 180
  - 2020: 165
  - 2021: 198
  - 2022: 225

  ### Q1. Highest Growth Year
  2019: (180-150)/150 = 20%
  2020: (165-180)/180 = -8.3%
  2021: (198-165)/165 = 20%
  2022: (225-198)/198 = 13.6%
  Answer: 2019 or 2021 (both 20%)

  ### Q2. CAGR Calculation
  CAGR = [(225/150)^(1/4) - 1] × 100 ≈ 10.7%

  question: In a stacked bar chart, what does the total height represent?
  options:
  - 'Average of all components'
  - 'Sum of all components'
  - 'Maximum component'
  - 'Difference between components'
  correct_answer: 'Sum of all components'
  explanation: "In stacked bar charts, components are stacked on top of each other, so total height = sum of all."
