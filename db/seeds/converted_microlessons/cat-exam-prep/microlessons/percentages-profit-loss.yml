  ## Core Concepts

  ### Percentage Basics

  **Definition:** Percentage means "per hundred" or "out of 100"

  **Key Formulas:**
  - Percentage = (Part/Whole) × 100
  - Part = (Percentage × Whole)/100
  - Whole = (Part × 100)/Percentage

  **Fraction-Percentage Equivalents (Memorize!):**
  - 1/2 = 50%
  - 1/3 = 33.33%
  - 1/4 = 25%
  - 1/5 = 20%
  - 1/6 = 16.67%
  - 1/8 = 12.5%
  - 1/10 = 10%
  - 1/12 = 8.33%

  ### Percentage Change

  **Increase:** New Value = Original × (1 + r/100)
  **Decrease:** New Value = Original × (1 - r/100)
  **Percentage Change = [(New - Old)/Old] × 100**

  **Successive Changes:**
  If price changes by a% then b%, net change = a + b + (ab/100)%

  ## Profit and Loss

  ### Basic Terms

  - **Cost Price (CP):** Price at which article is bought
  - **Selling Price (SP):** Price at which article is sold
  - **Marked Price (MP):** Price written on the article
  - **Profit:** SP > CP, Profit = SP - CP
  - **Loss:** CP > SP, Loss = CP - SP

  ### Important Formulas

  **Profit/Loss Percentage (always on CP):**
  - Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100
  - Loss% = (Loss/CP) × 100

  **Relation between SP and CP:**
  - SP = CP × (1 + Profit%/100)
  - SP = CP × (1 - Loss%/100)

  **Discount:**
  - Discount = MP - SP
  - Discount% = (Discount/MP) × 100
  - SP = MP × (1 - Discount%/100)

  ### Special Cases

  **False Weight:**
  Profit% = [(True Weight - False Weight)/False Weight] × 100

  **Two Articles Same SP:**
  - One sold at x% profit, other at x% loss
  - Net result is always LOSS
  - Loss% = x²/100

  ## Problem-Solving Patterns

  ### Pattern 1: Successive Discounts
  ```
  Problem: Two successive discounts of 20% and 10%
  Solution:
  Net discount = 20 + 10 - (20×10/100) = 28%
  OR
  Final price = Original × 0.8 × 0.9 = 0.72 × Original
  Discount = 28%
  ```

  ### Pattern 2: Profit on MP vs CP
  ```
  Problem: MP is 50% above CP, Discount is 20%. Find profit%
  Solution:
  Let CP = 100
  MP = 150
  SP = 150 × 0.8 = 120
  Profit = 20, Profit% = 20%
  ```

  ### Pattern 3: Population Growth
  ```
  Problem: Population increases 10% annually. Find after 3 years.
  Solution:
  Final = Initial × (1.1)³ = Initial × 1.331
  Increase = 33.1%
  ```

  ## CAT-Specific Tricks

  ### Quick Percentage Calculations
  - 15% of X = 10% of X + 5% of X = 0.1X + 0.05X
  - 37.5% = 3/8, 62.5% = 5/8, 87.5% = 7/8
  - To increase by 25%, multiply by 1.25 (or 5/4)
  - To decrease by 20%, multiply by 0.8 (or 4/5)

  - Always calculate profit/loss percentage on Cost Price
  - Successive changes use multiplication, not addition
