  # Syllogisms & Logical Deductions

  Master formal logical reasoning - standard CAT LRDI question type.

  ---

  ## Understanding Syllogisms

  ### Definition
  A syllogism is a logical argument where conclusion is derived from two premises.

  ### Standard Form
  - Major Premise: All A are B
  - Minor Premise: All B are C
  - Conclusion: All A are C

  ---

  ## Types of Statements

  ### Universal Affirmative (A)
  "All A are B"
  - Every member of A belongs to B
  - Some B may not be A

  ### Universal Negative (E)
  "No A is B"
  - No member of A belongs to B
  - No member of B belongs to A

  ### Particular Affirmative (I)
  "Some A are B"
  - At least one A is B
  - At least one B is A

  ### Particular Negative (O)
  "Some A are not B"
  - At least one A is not B
  - Says nothing about B

  ## Venn Diagram Method

  ### Drawing Conventions
  - Circle for each category
  - Shading for empty regions
  - X for "at least one exists"

  ### Universal Statements
  - "All A are B": A circle inside B circle
  - "No A is B": Circles don't overlap

  ### Particular Statements
  - "Some A are B": Circles overlap with X in intersection
  - "Some A are not B": A extends outside B with X

  ---

  ## Common Valid Conclusions

  ### From Two Universals
  1. All A are B + All B are C → All A are C
  2. All A are B + No B is C → No A is C
  3. No A is B + All B are C → Some C are not A

  ### Important Rules
  - Two particular premises → No conclusion
  - Two negative premises → No conclusion
  - One negative premise → Negative conclusion (if any)

  ---

  ## Practice Problems

  ### 1. Basic Syllogism [Easy]
  Premises: All dogs are animals. All animals breathe.
  Conclusion: All dogs breathe.
  **Valid?** Yes - follows AAA pattern

  ### 2. Negative Premise [Medium]
  Premises: All managers are employees. No employee is lazy.
  Conclusion: No manager is lazy.
  **Valid?** Yes - All M are E, No E is L → No M is L

  ### 3. Complex Deduction [Hard]
  Premises:
  - Some cats are black
  - All black things are beautiful
  - No beautiful thing is cheap

  Which follows?
  A) Some cats are beautiful ✓
  B) Some cats are not cheap ✓
  Answer: Both A and B

  ## CAT-Specific Tips

  1. Draw Venn diagrams quickly
  2. Check all possible diagrams for particular statements
  3. "Only A are B" means "All B are A"
  4. "All A are B" doesn't mean "All B are A"

  ## Key Takeaways

  - Syllogisms follow strict logical rules
  - Venn diagrams visualize relationships
  - Two negatives or two particulars yield no conclusion
  - Practice improves pattern recognition

exercises:
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 1
  question: "Premises: All dogs are animals. All animals breathe. What can we conclude?"
  options:
  - 'All animals are dogs'
  - 'All dogs breathe'
  - 'Some dogs do not breathe'
  - 'No conclusion possible'
  correct_answer: 'All dogs breathe'
  explanation: "All A are B + All B are C → All A are C. All dogs are animals, all animals breathe → all dogs breathe."
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 2
  question: "What does 'Only A are B' mean in syllogism terms?"
  options:
  - 'All A are B'
  - 'All B are A'
  - 'Some A are B'
  - 'No A is B'
  correct_answer: 'All B are A'
  explanation: "'Only A are B' means B is exclusively within A, so All B are A."
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 3
  question: What happens with two negative premises?
  options:
  - 'Always gives positive conclusion'
  - 'No definite conclusion possible'
  - 'Always gives negative conclusion'
  - 'Gives universal conclusion'
  correct_answer: 'No definite conclusion possible'
  explanation: "Two negative premises cannot yield any valid conclusion in syllogistic logic."
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 4
  question: "Premises: All managers are employees. No employee is lazy. Conclusion?"
  options:
  - 'Some managers are lazy'
  - 'No manager is lazy'
  - 'All lazy people are managers'
  - 'No conclusion possible'
  correct_answer: 'No manager is lazy'
  explanation: "All M are E, No E is L → No M is L (valid syllogism)"
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 5
  question: In Venn diagrams for syllogisms, 'X' mark represents:
  options:
  - 'Empty region'
  - 'At least one element exists'
  - 'All elements'
  - 'No elements'
  correct_answer: 'At least one element exists'
  explanation: "X marks indicate that at least one element exists in that region (used for particular statements)."
  require_pass: true
