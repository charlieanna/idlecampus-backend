  # Grammar & Sentence Correction

  Master English grammar rules for error-free CAT verbal section performance.

  ---

  ## Subject-Verb Agreement

  ### Basic Rules

  1. **Singular subject → Singular verb**
     - The cat runs. (NOT run)

  2. **Plural subject → Plural verb**
     - The cats run. (NOT runs)

  3. **Compound subjects with 'and' → Plural**
     - Tom and Jerry are friends.

  ### Tricky Cases

  1. **Either/Or, Neither/Nor**
     - Verb agrees with nearest subject
     - Neither the teacher nor the students were happy.

  2. **Collective Nouns**
     - Usually singular: The team is winning.

  3. **Indefinite Pronouns**
     - Singular: Everyone, someone, nobody, each
     - Plural: Both, few, many, several

  4. **Words between subject and verb**
     - The box of apples is heavy. (NOT are)

  ## Tense Consistency

  ### Common Errors

  1. **Mixing past and present**
     - Wrong: He walked to the store and buys milk.
     - Right: He walked to the store and bought milk.

  2. **Conditional sentences**
     - If + present, will + base verb
     - If + past, would + base verb

  ---

  ## Pronoun Errors

  ### Agreement
  - Pronoun must agree with antecedent
  - Wrong: Everyone should bring their book.
  - Right: Everyone should bring his or her book.

  ### Case Errors
  - Subject case: I, he, she, we, they
  - Object case: me, him, her, us, them
  - Wrong: Him and me went to store.
  - Right: He and I went to the store.

  ---

  ## Parallelism

  ### Rule
  Items in a series should have the same grammatical form.

  **Examples:**
  - Wrong: She likes swimming, to run, and biking.
  - Right: She likes swimming, running, and biking.

  ---

  ## Modifier Placement

  ### Dangling Modifiers
  - Wrong: Walking to school, the rain started.
  - Right: Walking to school, I got caught in the rain.

  ### Misplaced Modifiers
  - Wrong: She almost ate the whole cake.
  - Right: She ate almost the whole cake.
