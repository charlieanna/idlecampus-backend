  ## Arithmetic Progression (AP)

  ### Definition
  Sequence where difference between consecutive terms is constant.
  a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ...

  **Key Terms:**
  - First term (a)
  - Common difference (d)
  - nth term = a + (n-1)d

  ### Important Formulas

  **nth Term:** Tₙ = a + (n-1)d

  **Sum of n terms:** Sₙ = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]
  OR Sₙ = n/2 [first term + last term]

  **Properties:**
  - If three numbers in AP: 2b = a + c
  - Middle term = Average of AP
  - Sum of first n natural numbers = n(n+1)/2
  - Sum of first n odd numbers = n²
  - Sum of first n even numbers = n(n+1)

  ## Geometric Progression (GP)

  ### Definition
  Sequence where ratio between consecutive terms is constant.
  a, ar, ar², ar³, ...

  **Key Terms:**
  - First term (a)
  - Common ratio (r)
  - nth term = arⁿ⁻¹

  ### Important Formulas

  **nth Term:** Tₙ = arⁿ⁻¹

  **Sum of n terms:**
  - If r ≠ 1: Sₙ = a(rⁿ - 1)/(r - 1) or a(1 - rⁿ)/(1 - r)
  - If r = 1: Sₙ = na

  **Sum of infinite GP (|r| < 1):**
  S∞ = a/(1 - r)

  **Properties:**
  - If three numbers in GP: b² = ac
  - Geometric mean of a and c: √(ac)

  ## Practice Problems

  ### 1. AP Term Finding [Easy]
  Find the 20th term of AP: 3, 7, 11, 15...

  **Solution:**
  a = 3, d = 4
  T₂₀ = 3 + (20-1)×4 = 3 + 76 = 79

  ### 2. AP Sum [Medium]
  Find sum of first 50 terms of AP: 1, 3, 5, 7...

  **Solution:**
  This is sum of first 50 odd numbers = 50² = 2500

  ### 3. GP Finding [Medium]
  In GP, third term is 24 and sixth term is 192. Find first term.

  **Solution:**
  ar² = 24, ar⁵ = 192
  Dividing: r³ = 8, r = 2
  a = 24/4 = 6

  ### 4. Infinite GP [Hard]
  Find sum: 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... to infinity

  **Solution:**
  a = 1/2, r = 1/2
  S∞ = (1/2)/(1 - 1/2) = 1

  ## Key Takeaways

  - AP has constant difference, GP has constant ratio
  - AP sum formula involves first and last term
  - Infinite GP sum exists only if |r| < 1
  - Many CAT problems combine AP/GP with other concepts
