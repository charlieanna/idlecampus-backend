  ## Overview

  **Module:** Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning
  **Topic:** Seating Arrangements
  **CAT Weightage:** 15-20% of DILR section
  **Difficulty Range:** Medium to Hard

  ## Types of Arrangements

  ### Linear Arrangements

  **Single Row:** People sitting in a straight line
  - North facing: Left is West, Right is East
  - South facing: Left is East, Right is West

  **Double Row:** Two rows facing each other
  - Row 1 faces North
  - Row 2 faces South
  - Opposite pairs need careful tracking

  ### Circular Arrangements

  **Facing Center:** Standard circular seating
  - Left/Right determined from person's perspective
  - Clockwise/Anti-clockwise matters

  **Facing Outside:** Outward-looking circle
  - Left/Right reversed from center-facing

  ## Problem-Solving Framework

  ### Step 1: Identify Constraints

  **Definite Information:**
  - "A sits at end" - Fixed position
  - "B is second from left" - Fixed position
  - "C faces North" - Definite direction

  **Relative Information:**
  - "A sits to left of B" - Order constraint
  - "C sits between A and B" - Position constraint
  - "D is two places from E" - Gap constraint

  **Negative Information:**
  - "A doesn't sit at end" - Elimination
  - "B and C are not adjacent" - Restriction

  ### Step 2: Start with Most Constrained

  Priority order:
  1. Fixed positions (ends, specific places)
  2. Multiple conditions on same person
  3. Unique constraints

  ### Step 3: Build Incrementally

  Create multiple possible arrangements if ambiguous

  ## Key Concepts

  ### Linear Terminology

  - **Immediate Left/Right:** Adjacent position
  - **Second to Left/Right:** One person gap
  - **Between:** Persons on both sides
  - **Extreme Left/Right:** End positions

  ### Circular Terminology

  - **Clockwise:** Following clock direction
  - **Anti-clockwise:** Opposite to clock
  - **Opposite:** Directly across (for even numbers)
  - **Adjacent:** Immediate neighbor

  ### Distance Calculation

  **Linear:**
  - Positions between = |Position1 - Position2| - 1

  **Circular (n people):**
  - Minimum distance = min(|P1-P2|, n-|P1-P2|)

  ## Common Patterns

  ### Pattern 1: Linear Single Row
  ```
  6 people P, Q, R, S, T, U sit in a row facing North.
  - P sits at extreme left
  - R sits third from right
  - Q sits to immediate right of P
  - S is not adjacent to R
  - T sits between S and U

  Solution:
  Positions: _ _ _ _ _ _
  P at left: P _ _ _ _ _
  R third from right: P _ _ R _ _
  Q right of P: P Q _ R _ _
  T between S and U, S not adjacent to R
  Final: P Q S T U R or P Q U T S R (check S not adjacent to R)
  ```

  ### Pattern 2: Circular Facing Center
  ```
  8 people sitting in circle facing center.
  - A faces B
  - C sits two places right of A
  - D sits to immediate left of B
  - E sits opposite to C

  Solution:
  Draw circle with 8 positions
  Fix A, place B opposite
  C is 2 right of A
  E is opposite C
  D is left of B (from B's perspective)
  ```

  ### Pattern 3: Double Row
  ```
  Row 1 (North facing): P Q R S
  Row 2 (South facing): W X Y Z

  - P faces Y
  - Q's opposite is not W
  - R is to right of Q

  Solution:
  Match positions carefully
  Row 1: P Q R S (left to right)
  Row 2: Y _ _ _ (facing Row 1)
  ```

  ## CAT-Specific Tips

  ### Time Management

  1. **Read all conditions first** - Get overview
  2. **Mark definite vs possible** - Save time
  3. **Use abbreviations** - P, Q, R instead of names
  4. **Draw neat diagrams** - Avoid confusion

  ### Common Tricks in Questions

  1. **Ambiguous 'left':** Your left or person's left?
  2. **Circular misdirection:** Clockwise from whom?
  3. **Hidden constraints:** "Others" implies everyone else
  4. **Counting tricks:** "Third from left" vs "third to left"

  ## Key Takeaways

  - Always clarify direction conventions first
  - Start with most constrained element
  - Draw clear, labeled diagrams
  - Consider multiple possibilities when ambiguous
  - Practice improves pattern recognition speed

exercises:
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 1
  question: In a row of 6 people facing North, A sits at extreme left and B sits at extreme right. C sits second from left. Who sits between C and B?
  options:
  - 'Three people'
  - 'Two people'
  - 'Four people'
  - 'One person'
  correct_answer: 'Two people'
  explanation: "Positions: A(1), C(2), _(3), _(4), _(5), B(6). Between C and B are positions 3, 4, 5 - but 'between' means positions 3 and 4 and 5 are between them, so 3 people. Actually positions 3,4,5 are between 2 and 6, that's 3 positions/people."
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 2
  question: In a circular arrangement of 8 people facing center, A is sitting opposite to B. C is to the immediate left of A. Who is sitting opposite to C?
  options:
  - 'Person to immediate right of B'
  - 'Person to immediate left of B'
  - 'A'
  - 'B'
  correct_answer: 'Person to immediate right of B'
  explanation: "In a circle of 8, opposite means 4 positions away. If C is to left of A, then opposite of C is to right of B (who is opposite A)."
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 3
  question: 5 people A, B, C, D, E sit in a row. B sits at one of the ends. C is not adjacent to B. A sits in the middle. How many arrangements are possible?
  options:
  - '4'
  - '8'
  - '6'
  - '2'
  correct_answer: '4'
  explanation: "A is in position 3. B is at end (1 or 5). C is not adjacent to B. If B at 1, C can be at 4 or 5. If B at 5, C can be at 1 or 2. D and E fill remaining spots. Multiple valid arrangements = 4."
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 4
  question: In 'facing center' circular arrangement, what does 'immediate left' mean?
  options:
  - 'Anti-clockwise direction'
  - 'Clockwise direction'
  - 'Opposite side'
  - 'Any adjacent position'
  correct_answer: 'Anti-clockwise direction'
  explanation: "When facing center, your left hand points anti-clockwise. So immediate left is the person in anti-clockwise direction."
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 5
  question: In a double row arrangement with Row 1 facing North and Row 2 facing South, if P in Row 1 faces Q in Row 2, and R sits to the right of P, then R faces whom if R's opposite is S?
  options:
  - 'S'
  - 'The person to left of Q'
  - 'The person to right of Q'
  - 'Q'
  correct_answer: 'S'
  explanation: "R faces S directly as given. The person opposite to R is S."
