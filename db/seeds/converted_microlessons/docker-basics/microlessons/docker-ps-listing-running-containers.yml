  \ docker ps: Your Container Dashboard\n\n    ## What is docker ps?\n    The `docker\
  \ ps` command is your primary tool for viewing running containers. Think of it as\
  \ the \"process list\" for Docker containers - similar to how `ps` shows running\
  \ processes in Linux, `docker ps` shows your active containers.\n\n    ## Why It's\
  \ Important\n    - **Monitoring**: See which containers are currently running\n\
  \    - **Troubleshooting**: Check container status, ports, and names\n    - **Resource\
  \ Management**: Identify containers consuming resources\n    - **Quick Reference**:\
  \ Get container IDs for other Docker commands\n\n    ## Common Use Cases\n\n   \
  \ ### 1. Check Running Containers\n    ```bash\n    docker ps\n    ```\n    Shows\
  \ only currently running containers with essential information.\n\n    ### 2. See\
  \ All Containers (Including Stopped)\n    ```bash\n    docker ps -a\n    ```\n \
  \   The `-a` flag shows all containers, regardless of their state.\n\n    ### 3.\
  \ Filter by Status\n    ```bash\n    docker ps -a --filter \"status=exited\"\n \
  \   ```\n    Find all stopped containers for cleanup.\n\n    ### 4. Show Only Container\
  \ IDs\n    ```bash\n    docker ps -q\n    ```\n    Useful for scripting and piping\
  \ to other commands.\n\n    ## Output Columns Explained\n\n    ```\n    CONTAINER\
  \ ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS        PORTS\
  \                  NAMES\n    abc123def456   nginx:alpine  \"nginx -g 'daemon of…\"\
  \   2 hours ago    Up 2 hours    0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   web-server\n    ```\n\n\
  \    - **CONTAINER ID**: Unique identifier (short form)\n    - **IMAGE**: Docker\
  \ image used to create the container\n    - **COMMAND**: Command running inside\
  \ the container\n    - **CREATED**: When the container was created\n    - **STATUS**:\
  \ Current state (Up/Exited/Paused)\n    - **PORTS**: Port mappings between host\
  \ and container\n    - **NAMES**: Human-friendly name (auto-generated or custom)\n\
  \n    ## Visual Example\n\n    ```\n    Your Terminal\n         │\n         ├─ docker\
  \ ps\n         │\n         └─> Shows Running Containers\n              ├─ web-server\
  \ (nginx)\n              ├─ database (mysql)\n              └─ cache (redis)\n \
  \   ```\n\n    ## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n    1. **Forgetting -a**: Running\
  \ `docker ps` only shows running containers. Use `-a` to see stopped ones.\n   \
  \ 2. **Confusing Names and IDs**: You can use either the container name or ID in\
  \ commands.\n    3. **Not Using Filters**: For large environments, use filters to\
  \ narrow results.\n    4. **Ignoring Status**: Always check the STATUS column -\
  \ \"Up\" doesn't mean \"healthy\".\n\n    ## Pro Tips\n\n    - Use `--format` for\
  \ custom output: `docker ps --format \"{{.Names}}: {{.Status}}\"`\n    - Combine\
  \ with `grep`: `docker ps | grep nginx`\n    - Use `-n 5` to show only the last\
  \ 5 containers\n    - Set aliases: `alias dps='docker ps --format \"table {{.Names}}\\\
  \\t{{.Status}}\\\\t{{.Ports}}\"'`\n\n    ## When to Use docker ps\n\n    - Before\
  \ starting a new container (check for port conflicts)\n    - After deploying services\
  \ (verify they're running)\n    - During troubleshooting (check container status)\n\
  \    - Before cleanup operations (identify containers to remove)\n\n## Syntax/Command\n\
  \n```bash\ndocker ps\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```bash\ndocker ps -a\n```\n\n## Key\
  \ Points\n\n- Start with basic \"docker ps\" to see running containers\n\n- Add\
  \ -a flag to see all containers including stopped ones\n\n- Use -q to get just container\
  \ IDs (useful for scripting)"

  question: What flag should you add to "docker ps" to see stopped containers?
  options:
  - -a or --all
  - -s or --stopped
  - -e or --exited
  - --show-stopped
  correct_answer: -a or --all
  explanation: "The -a (or --all) flag shows all containers regardless of their state - running, stopped, or exited. By default, 'docker ps' only displays currently running containers. There is no -s, -e, or --show-stopped flag; -a is the standard way to include stopped containers in the listing."
