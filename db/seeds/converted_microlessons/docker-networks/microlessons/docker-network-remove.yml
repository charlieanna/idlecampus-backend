  - Remove network: docker network rm <name>


  - Remove multiple: docker network rm <name1> <name2>


  - Remove unused: docker network prune'

  question: Can you remove a Docker network that has containers still connected to it?
  options:
  - No, you must disconnect all containers from the network first
  - Yes, containers automatically disconnect when the network is removed
  - Yes, but only if you use the -f (force) flag
  - Only if all connected containers are stopped
  correct_answer: No, you must disconnect all containers from the network first
  explanation: "Docker will refuse to remove a network that has containers connected to it, showing an error like 'network has active endpoints'. You must first disconnect all containers using 'docker network disconnect' or stop/remove the containers, then you can remove the network."
  require_pass: true
