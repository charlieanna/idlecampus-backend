  Disconnect a container from a network


  ## Syntax/Command


  ```bash

  docker network disconnect my-network my-container

  ```


  ## Example


  ```bash

  docker network disconnect -f my-network my-container

  ```


  ## Key Points


  - Disconnect: docker network disconnect <network> <container>


  - Force disconnect: -f flag'
exercises:
- type: terminal
  problem_statement: Disconnect the container 'my-container' from the network 'my-network' to isolate it from other containers on that network
  expected_output: Silent success (container disconnected with no output)

  question: What happens when you disconnect a container from its only network?
  options:
  - The container loses all network connectivity and becomes isolated
  - The container is automatically stopped
  - The container automatically joins the default bridge network
  - The operation fails with an error
  correct_answer: The container loses all network connectivity and becomes isolated
  explanation: "When you disconnect a container from its only network, it loses all network connectivity. The container continues running but has no network interfaces (except loopback). It won't automatically join another network - you must explicitly connect it to a network if you want to restore connectivity."
