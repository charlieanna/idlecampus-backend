  Create custom Docker networks for container communication


  ## Syntax/Command


  ```bash

  docker network create my-network

  ```


  ## Example


  ```bash

  docker network create --driver bridge my-network

  ```


  ## Key Points


  - Create network: docker network create <name>


  - Specify driver: --driver bridge


  - Set subnet: --subnet <cidr>'
exercises:
- type: terminal
  problem_statement: Create a custom Docker network named 'my-network' to enable container-to-container communication
  expected_output: Network ID returned confirming successful creation
  language: bash

  question: What is the default network driver in Docker?
  options:
  - bridge (for isolated container communication on a single host)
  - host (containers share host's network stack)
  - overlay (for multi-host swarm communication)
  - macvlan (assigns MAC addresses to containers)
  correct_answer: bridge (for isolated container communication on a single host)
  explanation: "The default network driver in Docker is 'bridge', which creates an isolated network where containers can communicate with each other by name while being separated from the host network. Host driver removes network isolation, overlay is for swarm mode across multiple hosts, and macvlan gives containers their own MAC addresses."
