  question: What does docker network prune remove?
  options:
  - Only custom networks that are not currently used by any containers
  - All custom networks regardless of usage
  - All networks including default networks (bridge, host, none)
  - Only networks created more than 1 day ago
  correct_answer: Only custom networks that are not currently used by any containers
  explanation: "docker network prune removes only user-created networks that have no containers connected to them. It never removes the default networks (bridge, host, none) and won't remove networks that are in use. This makes it safe to run regularly for cleanup without disrupting running containers."
