  question: Which default networks are created by Docker on installation?
  options:
  - bridge, host, and none
  - Only bridge
  - bridge, public, and private
  - default, overlay, and nat
  correct_answer: bridge, host, and none
  explanation: "Docker creates three default networks on installation: 'bridge' (the default network for containers), 'host' (removes network isolation), and 'none' (disables networking). You can see these by running 'docker network ls'."
  require_pass: true
