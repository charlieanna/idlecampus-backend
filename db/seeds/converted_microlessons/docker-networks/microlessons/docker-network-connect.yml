  Connect a running container to a network


  ## Syntax/Command


  ```bash

  docker network connect my-network my-container

  ```


  ## Example


  ```bash

  docker network connect --ip 172.18.0.22 my-network my-container

  ```


  ## Key Points


  - Connect container: docker network connect <network> <container>


  - Assign IP: --ip <address>


  - Add alias: --alias <name>'
exercises:
- type: terminal
  problem_statement: Connect a running container named 'my-container' to the network 'my-network' to enable communication with other containers on that network
  expected_output: Silent success (container connected with no output)
  language: bash

  question: Can a container be connected to multiple networks simultaneously?
  options:
  - Yes, containers can join multiple networks and will have network interfaces for each
  - No, containers can only be on one network at a time
  - Only in Docker Swarm mode
  - Only with overlay networks
  correct_answer: Yes, containers can join multiple networks and will have network interfaces for each
  explanation: "A container can be connected to multiple networks simultaneously using docker network connect. The container will have a separate network interface for each network it's connected to. This enables complex networking scenarios like connecting a web server to both a public network and a private database network."
