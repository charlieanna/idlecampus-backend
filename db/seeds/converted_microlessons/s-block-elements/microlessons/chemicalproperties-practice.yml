  Basicity of hydroxides increases down the group: Be(OH)₂ < Mg(OH)₂ < Ca(OH)₂ < Sr(OH)₂
  < Ba(OH)₂. Ba(OH)₂ is the strongest base. Be(OH)₂ is amphoteric.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following is the strongest base?
  options:
  - Be(OH)₂
  - Mg(OH)₂
  - Ca(OH)₂
  - Ba(OH)₂
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Ba(OH)₂
  explanation: 'Ba(OH)₂ (barium hydroxide) is the strongest base among alkaline earth
    metal hydroxides. Basicity increases down Group 2: Be(OH)₂ < Mg(OH)₂ < Ca(OH)₂
    < Sr(OH)₂ < Ba(OH)₂. This trend occurs because: (1) As atomic size increases
    down the group, M-OH bond becomes weaker and more ionic, making it easier to
    release OH⁻ ions. (2) Smaller cations have higher charge density, leading to
    greater covalent character in M-OH bonds, reducing basicity. Be(OH)₂ is amphoteric
    (reacts with both acids and bases), not basic. Mg(OH)₂ is weakly basic (sparingly
    soluble). Ca(OH)₂, Sr(OH)₂, and Ba(OH)₂ are increasingly strong bases, with Ba(OH)₂
    being comparable to strong alkali metal hydroxides like NaOH and KOH.'

  question: What is the nature of Be(OH)₂ (beryllium hydroxide)?
  options:
  - Strongly basic
  - Weakly basic
  - Amphoteric
  - Acidic
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Amphoteric
  explanation: 'Be(OH)₂ is amphoteric, meaning it can react with both acids and bases.
    With acids: Be(OH)₂ + 2HCl → BeCl₂ + 2H₂O (acts as a base). With bases: Be(OH)₂
    + 2NaOH → Na₂[Be(OH)₄] or Na₂BeO₂ + 2H₂O (acts as an acid). This amphoteric
    nature is due to the high charge density of Be²⁺ (small size, +2 charge), which
    leads to high polarizing power and covalent character in its compounds. Be(OH)₂
    is the only amphoteric hydroxide among Group 2 elements, making beryllium anomalous.
    This property is part of the diagonal relationship between Be and Al, as Al(OH)₃
    is also amphoteric. All other Group 2 hydroxides (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) are basic,
    with basicity increasing down the group.'

  question: How does the solubility of alkaline earth metal hydroxides change down
    the group?
  options:
  - Solubility decreases down the group
  - Solubility increases down the group
  - Solubility remains constant
  - No clear trend exists
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Solubility increases down the group
  explanation: 'The solubility of alkaline earth metal hydroxides increases down
    the group: Be(OH)₂ < Mg(OH)₂ < Ca(OH)₂ < Sr(OH)₂ < Ba(OH)₂. Be(OH)₂ is sparingly
    soluble, Mg(OH)₂ is only slightly soluble (Ksp = 1.8 × 10⁻¹¹), while Ca(OH)₂
    is moderately soluble (used as lime water), and Ba(OH)₂ is highly soluble. The
    increasing solubility is due to the decreasing lattice enthalpy (energy required
    to break the crystal lattice) down the group, which decreases faster than the
    hydration enthalpy. As ionic size increases, the lattice becomes weaker, making
    dissolution easier. This trend is opposite to that of sulfates, where solubility
    decreases down the group.'
