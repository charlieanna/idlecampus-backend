  Potassium forms superoxide (KO₂) when heated in excess oxygen. Lithium forms normal
  oxide (Li₂O), sodium forms peroxide (Na₂O₂), and heavier alkali metals (K, Rb, Cs)
  form superoxides.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which alkali metal forms normal oxide (M₂O) when burned in air?
  options:
  - Sodium
  - Potassium
  - Lithium
  - Cesium
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Lithium
  explanation: 'Lithium is the only alkali metal that forms normal oxide (Li₂O) when
    burned in air or oxygen: 4Li + O₂ → 2Li₂O. The type of oxide formed depends on
    the size of the metal cation and the stability of different oxide ions: (1) Lithium
    (smallest cation) → normal oxide Li₂O, (2) Sodium → peroxide Na₂O₂ (4Na + O₂
    → 2Na₂O₂), (3) Potassium, Rubidium, Cesium (larger cations) → superoxides KO₂,
    RbO₂, CsO₂ (K + O₂ → KO₂). This trend occurs because larger cations can stabilize
    larger anions (O₂²⁻ in peroxides, O₂⁻ in superoxides). The normal oxide ion O²⁻
    is most stable with the smallest Li⁺ cation.'

  question: What products are formed when alkali metals react with water?
  options:
  - Metal oxide and hydrogen gas
  - Metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas
  - Metal oxide and oxygen gas
  - Metal hydroxide and oxygen gas
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas
  explanation: 'Alkali metals react vigorously with water to produce metal hydroxide
    and hydrogen gas: 2M + 2H₂O → 2MOH + H₂↑. For example: 2Na + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂↑.
    The reaction is highly exothermic (releases heat). Reactivity increases down
    the group: Li < Na < K < Rb < Cs. Lithium reacts steadily, sodium reacts vigorously
    (melts into a ball and skates on water surface), potassium reacts so violently
    that the hydrogen ignites (producing lilac flame), and rubidium/cesium react
    explosively. The hydroxides formed (LiOH, NaOH, KOH, etc.) are strong bases.
    This high reactivity is why alkali metals must be stored under oil to prevent
    contact with moisture in air.'
