  CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ (already balanced). This reaction occurs at high temperature (~1200
  K) and is the basis for manufacturing quicklime from limestone.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'Balance the thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate: CaCO₃ →'
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 2
  question: What is the balanced equation for the reaction between calcium and water?
  options:
  - Ca + H₂O → CaO + H₂
  - Ca + 2H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + H₂
  - 2Ca + 2H₂O → 2CaOH + H₂
  - Ca + H₂O → CaOH + H
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Ca + 2H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + H₂
  explanation: 'The balanced equation for calcium reacting with water is: Ca + 2H₂O
    → Ca(OH)₂ + H₂. Calcium reacts readily with cold water to produce calcium hydroxide
    (slaked lime) and hydrogen gas. The reaction is moderately vigorous and exothermic.
    The hydrogen gas produced can be collected and tested with a lighted splint (it
    burns with a pop sound). All alkaline earth metals from Ca onwards react with
    cold water following the general equation: M + 2H₂O → M(OH)₂ + H₂, where M represents
    the metal. The reactivity increases down the group: Ca < Sr < Ba, with barium
    reacting most vigorously. This reaction is used to produce calcium hydroxide
    on an industrial scale.'

  question: 'When sodium reacts with oxygen, which balanced equation represents the
    formation of sodium peroxide?'
  options:
  - 4Na + O₂ → 2Na₂O
  - 2Na + O₂ → 2NaO₂
  - 2Na + O₂ → Na₂O₂
  - Na + O₂ → NaO₂
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 2Na + O₂ → Na₂O₂
  explanation: 'The balanced equation for sodium forming peroxide is: 2Na + O₂ →
    Na₂O₂ (sodium peroxide). Sodium preferentially forms peroxide (Na₂O₂) rather
    than normal oxide when burned in air or oxygen. The peroxide ion is O₂²⁻, not
    O²⁻. Different alkali metals form different oxides: Lithium → normal oxide (4Li
    + O₂ → 2Li₂O), Sodium → peroxide (2Na + O₂ → Na₂O₂), Potassium, Rubidium, Cesium
    → superoxides (K + O₂ → KO₂). This trend is due to the larger alkali metal cations
    being better able to stabilize the larger peroxide (O₂²⁻) and superoxide (O₂⁻)
    anions. Sodium peroxide is a pale yellow solid used as an oxidizing agent and
    in air purification systems (it absorbs CO₂ and releases O₂).'
