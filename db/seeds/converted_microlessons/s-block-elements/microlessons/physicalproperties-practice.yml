  Potassium is less dense than sodium (K < Na) despite being below it in the group.
  This is anomalous because density generally increases down the group. The large
  increase in atomic volume of K overshadows the mass increase.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which alkali metal shows an anomalous trend in density?
  options:
  - Lithium - highest density
  - Potassium - less dense than sodium
  - Cesium - lowest density
  - No anomaly in density trend
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Potassium - less dense than sodium
  explanation: 'Potassium shows an anomalous density trend - it is less dense than
    sodium (K: 0.86 g/cm³ < Na: 0.97 g/cm³), despite being lower in the group. Normally,
    density increases down a group as atomic mass increases. However, potassium has
    an unusually large atomic radius and volume due to the addition of a new electron
    shell (n=4 vs n=3 for Na). The increase in volume (V ∝ r³) is so large that it
    more than compensates for the mass increase, resulting in lower density (ρ = m/V).
    After potassium, the normal trend resumes: Rb (1.53) and Cs (1.90) are denser.
    Lithium is the least dense of all metals (0.53 g/cm³).'

  question: Why do alkali metals have low melting and boiling points?
  options:
  - They have strong metallic bonding
  - They have weak metallic bonding due to single valence electron
  - They have covalent bonding
  - They have high lattice energy
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: They have weak metallic bonding due to single valence electron
  explanation: 'Alkali metals have low melting and boiling points because they have
    weak metallic bonding. Each atom contributes only one valence electron to the
    metallic bond (delocalized electron sea). The metallic bond strength depends
    on: (1) Number of valence electrons - alkali metals have only 1, (2) Charge on
    metal cation - only +1 for alkali metals, (3) Size of metal cation - larger size
    means weaker attraction. With only one delocalized electron per atom and large
    atomic size, the metallic bonding is weak. Melting points: Li (181°C) > Na (98°C)
    > K (64°C) > Rb (39°C) > Cs (29°C). They decrease down the group as atomic size
    increases and bond strength weakens further. Cesium melts just above room temperature.
    This makes alkali metals soft, easily cut with a knife, and gives them low hardness.'

  question: Why are alkali metals soft and can be cut with a knife?
  options:
  - They have a layered crystal structure
  - Weak metallic bonding allows easy deformation
  - They have low electronegativity
  - They react with air to become soft
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Weak metallic bonding allows easy deformation
  explanation: 'Alkali metals are soft and can be cut with a knife because their
    weak metallic bonding allows easy deformation. The softness results from: (1)
    Weak metallic bonds - only one valence electron per atom contributes to bonding,
    (2) Large atomic size - reduces the strength of electrostatic attraction between
    metal cations and delocalized electrons, (3) Low lattice energy - metal atoms
    can slide past each other easily when force is applied. Hardness decreases down
    the group: Li is hardest (can dent with knife), Na is softer (easily cut), K,
    Rb, Cs are very soft (can be cut like butter). When cut, they expose a shiny
    metallic surface that quickly tarnishes in air due to reaction with oxygen/moisture.
    This extreme softness is unique to alkali metals - no other metallic elements
    are this soft. In contrast, transition metals have multiple d-electrons contributing
    to bonding, making them hard.'
