  Permanent hardness (due to sulfates/chlorides) can be removed by: (1) Washing soda
  - Na₂CO₃ + CaSO₄ → CaCO₃↓ + Na₂SO₄, (2) Ion exchange resins, (3) Calgon\


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which methods can remove permanent hardness of water?
  options:
  - Boiling
  - Addition of washing soda (Na₂CO₃)
  - Clark's method using lime
  - Distillation
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Addition of washing soda (Na₂CO₃)
  explanation: 'Permanent hardness (caused by sulfates and chlorides of Ca²⁺ and
    Mg²⁺) can be removed by: (1) Washing soda (Na₂CO₃): Na₂CO₃ + CaSO₄ → CaCO₃↓
    + Na₂SO₄ or Na₂CO₃ + MgCl₂ → MgCO₃↓ + 2NaCl. The insoluble carbonates precipitate
    out. (2) Ion exchange resins - exchange Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ with Na⁺ or H⁺. (3) Calgon
    (sodium hexametaphosphate) - forms soluble complexes. (4) Permutit/zeolite process.
    Boiling and Clark''s method (adding lime) only remove temporary hardness (caused
    by bicarbonates). Distillation removes all impurities but is expensive. The most
    practical method for permanent hardness is washing soda treatment or ion exchange.'

  question: What causes temporary hardness in water?
  options:
  - Calcium and magnesium sulfates
  - Calcium and magnesium bicarbonates
  - Calcium and magnesium chlorides
  - Sodium and potassium carbonates
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Calcium and magnesium bicarbonates
  explanation: 'Temporary hardness is caused by dissolved calcium and magnesium bicarbonates
    - Ca(HCO₃)₂ and Mg(HCO₃)₂. It is called "temporary" because it can be easily
    removed by boiling: Ca(HCO₃)₂ → CaCO₃↓ + H₂O + CO₂↑ and Mg(HCO₃)₂ → MgCO₃↓
    + H₂O + CO₂↑. The insoluble carbonates precipitate as scale. Temporary hardness
    can also be removed by Clark''s method (adding calculated amount of lime): Ca(HCO₃)₂
    + Ca(OH)₂ → 2CaCO₃↓ + 2H₂O. Permanent hardness, in contrast, is caused by sulfates
    and chlorides (CaSO₄, MgSO₄, CaCl₂, MgCl₂) which do not decompose on boiling
    and require chemical treatment for removal.'

  question: Why is hard water problematic for domestic and industrial use?
  options:
  - It tastes bad and smells unpleasant
  - It wastes soap and forms scale in boilers
  - It is acidic and corrodes pipes
  - It contains harmful bacteria
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: It wastes soap and forms scale in boilers
  explanation: 'Hard water causes two main problems: (1) Wastes soap - Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺
    ions react with soap (sodium stearate) to form insoluble scum: 2C₁₇H₃₅COONa
    + Ca²⁺ → (C₁₇H₃₅COO)₂Ca↓ + 2Na⁺. Soap cannot lather until all hardness-causing
    ions are precipitated, wasting soap. (2) Forms scale in boilers and pipes - when
    hard water is heated, carbonates and sulfates precipitate as hard scale (mostly
    CaCO₃ and CaSO₄). This scale: reduces heat transfer efficiency, wastes fuel,
    can cause boiler explosions due to overheating, blocks pipes. In industries,
    scale formation in boilers is a serious problem. Hard water does not harm health
    - in fact, some minerals are beneficial. Synthetic detergents work even in hard
    water, unlike soap.'
