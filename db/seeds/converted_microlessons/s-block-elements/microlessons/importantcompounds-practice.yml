  Gypsum is CaSO₄·2H₂O (calcium sulfate dihydrate). When heated at 393 K, it loses
  1.5 molecules of water to form Plaster of Paris (CaSO₄·½H₂O).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

    of Paris?

  question: What is the chemical formula of Plaster of Paris?
  options:
  - CaSO₄·2H₂O
  - CaSO₄·½H₂O
  - CaSO₄
  - CaSO₄·H₂O
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: CaSO₄·½H₂O
  explanation: 'Plaster of Paris has the formula CaSO₄·½H₂O (calcium sulfate hemihydrate).
    It is prepared by heating gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) at 393 K (120°C): 2CaSO₄·2H₂O
    → 2(CaSO₄·½H₂O) + 3H₂O. When mixed with water, Plaster of Paris sets by re-absorbing
    water to form gypsum: CaSO₄·½H₂O + 1½H₂O → CaSO₄·2H₂O. This setting process
    causes slight expansion, making it ideal for creating casts and molds. Uses include:
    (1) Medical casts for broken bones, (2) Making statues and decorative items,
    (3) Dental casts, (4) Building construction. The name comes from large gypsum
    deposits near Paris, France. If heated above 473 K, anhydrous CaSO₄ (dead burnt
    plaster) is formed, which does not set with water.'

  question: What is the primary use of calcium oxide (quicklime)?
  options:
  - Manufacturing of cement and glass
  - Food preservation
  - Water purification
  - Production of fertilizers
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Manufacturing of cement and glass
  explanation: 'Calcium oxide (CaO), commonly called quicklime, is primarily used
    in manufacturing cement and glass. It is produced by thermal decomposition of
    limestone: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ (at ~1200 K). Major uses include: (1) Cement production
    - CaO is a key ingredient in Portland cement, (2) Glass manufacturing - acts
    as a flux, (3) Steel production - removes impurities like silica and phosphorus,
    (4) Water treatment - raises pH and softens hard water, (5) Agriculture - neutralizes
    acidic soils. When CaO reacts with water, it forms slaked lime: CaO + H₂O →
    Ca(OH)₂ + heat (highly exothermic). This reaction is used in construction (lime
    mortar) and chemical industries. Quicklime is one of the most important industrial
    chemicals, with millions of tons produced annually worldwide.'
