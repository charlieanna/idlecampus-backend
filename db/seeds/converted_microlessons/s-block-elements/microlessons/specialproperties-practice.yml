  question: Dilute solutions of alkali metals in liquid ammonia are _______ colored
    due to ammoniated electrons.

  question: What color are concentrated solutions of alkali metals in liquid ammonia?
  options:
  - Blue
  - Bronze with metallic luster
  - Green
  - Colorless
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Bronze with metallic luster
  explanation: 'Concentrated solutions of alkali metals in liquid ammonia are bronze
    colored with metallic luster. The color and properties depend on concentration:
    (1) Dilute solutions (~10⁻³ M) - deep blue color due to ammoniated electrons
    [e(NH₃)ₓ]⁻. These solutions are paramagnetic. (2) Concentrated solutions (~3
    M) - bronze/copper colored with metallic luster and high electrical conductivity
    (similar to metals). This occurs because electrons cluster together forming "electron
    pairs." The dissolution reaction is: M + (x+y)NH₃ → [M(NH₃)ₓ]⁺ + [e(NH₃)ᵧ]⁻.
    These solutions are powerful reducing agents and are used in organic synthesis
    (Birch reduction). They slowly decompose, releasing hydrogen: 2Na + 2NH₃ → 2NaNH₂
    + H₂.'

  question: Which property makes alkali metal-ammonia solutions useful in organic
    chemistry?
  options:
  - They are strong oxidizing agents
  - They are powerful reducing agents
  - They are good solvents for polar compounds
  - They catalyze polymerization reactions
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: They are powerful reducing agents
  explanation: 'Alkali metal solutions in liquid ammonia are powerful reducing agents,
    making them extremely useful in organic chemistry. The ammoniated electrons [e(NH₃)ₓ]⁻
    readily donate electrons to reduce other compounds. Key applications include:
    (1) Birch reduction - reduces aromatic rings to 1,4-cyclohexadienes. For example,
    benzene → 1,4-cyclohexadiene using Na in liquid NH₃. (2) Reducing alkynes to
    trans-alkenes. (3) Reducing alkyl halides to alkanes. (4) Reduction of ketones
    and esters. The blue solution provides a source of solvated electrons, which
    are among the most powerful reducing agents known. The solutions must be used
    immediately as they slowly decompose. This reducing power is due to the very
    negative reduction potential of the solvated electron.'
