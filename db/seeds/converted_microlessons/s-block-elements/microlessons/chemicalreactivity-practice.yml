  Reactivity with water increases down the group: Be < Mg < Ca < Sr < Ba. Be does
  not react (protective oxide), Mg reacts slowly with cold water, Ca/Sr/Ba react readily
  with cold water.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

    with water: Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba'

  question: Which alkaline earth metal does NOT react with cold water?
  options:
  - Magnesium
  - Calcium
  - Beryllium
  - Strontium
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Beryllium
  explanation: 'Beryllium does not react with cold water due to the formation of a
    protective oxide layer (BeO) on its surface. The reactivity with water increases
    down Group 2: Be (no reaction) < Mg (slow reaction with cold water, reacts readily
    with hot water/steam) < Ca, Sr, Ba (react readily with cold water). The reaction
    with water is: M + 2H₂O → M(OH)₂ + H₂↑. Reactivity increases down the group because:
    (1) Ionization energy decreases - easier to form M²⁺ ions, (2) Atomic size increases
    - valence electrons are farther from nucleus and more easily lost. Calcium and
    heavier alkaline earth metals react vigorously with cold water, producing hydroxides
    and hydrogen gas.'

  question: How does reactivity with oxygen vary down Group 2 (alkaline earth metals)?
  options:
  - Reactivity decreases down the group
  - Reactivity increases down the group
  - Reactivity remains constant
  - Only beryllium reacts with oxygen
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Reactivity increases down the group
  explanation: 'Reactivity with oxygen increases down Group 2. All alkaline earth
    metals react with oxygen to form oxides (2M + O₂ → 2MO), but the vigor of reaction
    increases from Be to Ba. Beryllium and magnesium react slowly at room temperature
    but burn brightly when heated. Calcium, strontium, and barium react more readily,
    tarnishing quickly in air. Barium is so reactive it must be stored under oil.
    The increasing reactivity is due to: (1) Decreasing ionization energy down the
    group - easier to lose electrons, (2) Decreasing bond dissociation energy of
    M-M bonds, (3) More negative reduction potential. The oxides become increasingly
    basic down the group: BeO (amphoteric) < MgO < CaO < SrO < BaO (strongly basic).'
