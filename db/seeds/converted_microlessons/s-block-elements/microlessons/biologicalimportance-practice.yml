  question: Magnesium is an essential component of _______, which is responsible for
    photosynthesis in plants.
  require_pass: true

  question: Which element is essential for the structure of bones and teeth?
  options:
  - Sodium
  - Potassium
  - Calcium
  - Magnesium
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Calcium
  explanation: 'Calcium is essential for bones and teeth structure. About 99% of
    the body''s calcium is stored in bones and teeth as calcium phosphate (Ca₃(PO₄)₂)
    and hydroxyapatite (Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂). Calcium provides strength and rigidity
    to the skeletal system. Deficiency of calcium leads to conditions like rickets
    in children and osteoporosis in adults. Calcium also plays vital roles in muscle
    contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and enzyme regulation. While
    magnesium is important for biological processes (including bones), calcium is
    the primary structural element for bones and teeth.'

  question: What is the biological role of magnesium in chlorophyll?
  options:
  - It acts as a catalyst for water splitting
  - It is present at the center of the chlorophyll molecule
  - It transports electrons during photosynthesis
  - It absorbs blue light wavelengths
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: It is present at the center of the chlorophyll molecule
  explanation: 'Magnesium is present at the center of the chlorophyll molecule, coordinated
    to four nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin ring. This Mg-porphyrin complex is essential
    for photosynthesis as it absorbs light energy (primarily red and blue wavelengths)
    and initiates the electron transfer process. Without magnesium, chlorophyll cannot
    function properly, and plants cannot perform photosynthesis. Magnesium deficiency
    in plants causes chlorosis (yellowing of leaves) because chlorophyll production
    is impaired. Each chlorophyll molecule contains one Mg²⁺ ion at its core, making
    magnesium indispensable for plant life and, consequently, all life on Earth.'
