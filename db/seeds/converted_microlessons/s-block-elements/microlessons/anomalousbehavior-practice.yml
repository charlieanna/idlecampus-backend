  TRUE. BeO is amphoteric. It reacts with acids: BeO + 2HCl → BeCl₂ + H₂O, and with
  bases: BeO + 2NaOH → Na₂BeO₂ + H₂O (sodium beryllate).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: Which property makes beryllium anomalous among alkaline earth metals?
  options:
  - BeO is amphoteric while other Group 2 oxides are basic
  - Beryllium has the lowest ionization energy
  - Beryllium reacts vigorously with water
  - Beryllium forms ionic compounds
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: BeO is amphoteric while other Group 2 oxides are basic
  explanation: 'Beryllium shows anomalous behavior compared to other alkaline earth
    metals. BeO is amphoteric (reacts with both acids and bases), while other Group
    2 oxides (MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO) are basic. With acids: BeO + 2HCl → BeCl₂ + H₂O.
    With bases: BeO + 2NaOH → Na₂BeO₂ + H₂O (sodium beryllate). This amphoteric
    nature arises from Be²⁺ having high charge density (high charge/radius ratio),
    leading to high polarizing power. Other anomalous properties of Be include: (1)
    BeCl₂ is covalent (others are ionic), (2) Be does not react with water (others
    do), (3) Be forms [Be(H₂O)₄]²⁺ (4-coordinate) while others form 6-coordinate
    complexes.'

  question: Why does beryllium not react with water while other alkaline earth metals
    do?
  options:
  - Beryllium has very low reactivity due to its position in the periodic table
  - A protective oxide layer (BeO) prevents reaction with water
  - Beryllium is a noble metal
  - Beryllium has a complete electron shell
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: A protective oxide layer (BeO) prevents reaction with water
  explanation: 'Beryllium does not react with water because it forms a tough, protective
    oxide layer (BeO) on its surface that prevents further reaction. This BeO layer
    is very stable and adheres tightly to the metal surface, acting as a barrier.
    In contrast, Mg reacts slowly with cold water, while Ca, Sr, and Ba react readily
    with cold water: M + 2H₂O → M(OH)₂ + H₂. The protective oxide phenomenon is similar
    to aluminum, which also forms a protective Al₂O₃ layer (this is part of the diagonal
    relationship between Be and Al). The oxide layer can be removed by amalgamation
    with mercury, after which Be will react with water.'
