  Ionization energy decreases down the group due to increasing atomic size. Lithium
  has the smallest atomic radius, so highest ionization energy among alkali metals.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which alkali metal has the highest ionization energy?
  options:
  - Lithium
  - Sodium
  - Potassium
  - Cesium
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Lithium
  explanation: 'Lithium has the highest ionization energy among all alkali metals
    (Group 1). Ionization energy is the energy required to remove an electron from
    a gaseous atom. It decreases down the group because: (1) Atomic radius increases
    - the outermost electron is farther from the nucleus, experiencing weaker electrostatic
    attraction. (2) Shielding effect increases - inner electron shells shield the
    outer electron from nuclear charge. Li has the smallest atomic radius and least
    shielding, so its valence electron is held most tightly. IE values: Li (520 kJ/mol)
    > Na (496) > K (419) > Rb (403) > Cs (376). This trend is opposite to atomic radius
    and similar to electronegativity.'

  question: How does atomic radius vary down Group 1 (alkali metals)?
  options:
  - Atomic radius decreases
  - Atomic radius increases
  - Atomic radius remains constant
  - First increases then decreases
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Atomic radius increases
  explanation: 'Atomic radius increases down Group 1 from Li to Cs. The trend: Li
    (152 pm) < Na (186 pm) < K (227 pm) < Rb (248 pm) < Cs (265 pm). This occurs
    because: (1) Each successive element has one additional electron shell (quantum
    shell), (2) The outermost electron is farther from the nucleus, (3) Although
    nuclear charge increases, the shielding effect by inner electrons more than compensates,
    reducing effective nuclear charge on outer electrons. The increasing atomic radius
    explains many periodic trends: decreasing ionization energy, decreasing electronegativity,
    increasing reactivity, and increasing metallic character down the group. Alkali
    metals have the largest atomic radii in their respective periods because they
    have only one valence electron with minimal inter-electronic repulsion in the
    valence shell.'

  question: Why does electronegativity decrease down Group 1?
  options:
  - Nuclear charge decreases
  - Atomic radius increases and shielding effect increases
  - Number of valence electrons decreases
  - Metallic character decreases
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Atomic radius increases and shielding effect increases
  explanation: 'Electronegativity decreases down Group 1 (Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs)
    because atomic radius increases and shielding effect increases. Electronegativity
    is the tendency of an atom to attract shared electrons in a chemical bond. Values:
    Li (1.0) > Na (0.9) > K (0.8) > Rb (0.8) > Cs (0.7) on Pauling scale. As we go
    down the group: (1) Atomic size increases - bonding electrons are farther from
    the nucleus, (2) Shielding by inner electrons increases - reduces effective nuclear
    charge felt by bonding electrons, (3) Both factors reduce the atom''s ability
    to attract electrons. Consequently, electronegativity decreases. This trend is
    consistent across all groups. Low electronegativity of alkali metals (especially
    Cs) makes them highly electropositive and reactive - they readily lose electrons
    to form +1 cations. Cesium is one of the least electronegative elements.'
