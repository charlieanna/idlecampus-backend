  In aqueous solution: Li > Na > K > Cs. Lithium is the strongest reducer due to high
  hydration enthalpy that compensates for its high ionization energy.

  question: 'Arrange the following alkali metals in order of DECREASING reducing power
    in aqueous solution: Li, Na, K, Cs'
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 2
  question: Which alkali metal is the strongest reducing agent in aqueous solution?
  options:
  - Lithium
  - Sodium
  - Potassium
  - Cesium
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Lithium
  explanation: 'Lithium is the strongest reducing agent among alkali metals in aqueous
    solution, despite having the highest ionization energy. The reducing power order
    in aqueous solution is: Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs. This trend seems counterintuitive
    but is explained by: (1) Hydration enthalpy - Li⁺ has the smallest size and highest
    charge density, so it has the highest hydration enthalpy (-520 kJ/mol). The large
    energy released during hydration more than compensates for the high ionization
    energy. (2) Standard electrode potential: Li⁺/Li has E° = -3.04 V (most negative),
    making Li the strongest reducer. The overall process is: M(s) → M⁺(g) → M⁺(aq).
    For Li, the second step (hydration) releases so much energy that the overall
    process is most favorable. In gaseous state or non-aqueous media, the order reverses.'

  question: Why is the reducing power trend different in aqueous solution versus gaseous
    state?
  options:
  - Ionization energy changes in solution
  - Hydration enthalpy plays a major role in solution
  - Temperature effects are different
  - Pressure affects the metal differently
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Hydration enthalpy plays a major role in solution
  explanation: 'In aqueous solution, hydration enthalpy plays a crucial role in determining
    reducing power, which is not present in gaseous state. Reducing power depends
    on: (1) Gaseous state: M(s) → M⁺(g) + e⁻. Here, only ionization energy matters.
    Cs has the lowest IE, so Cs > Rb > K > Na > Li (Cs is strongest). (2) Aqueous
    solution: M(s) → M⁺(aq) + e⁻. This involves two steps: M(s) → M⁺(g) + e⁻ (ionization),
    then M⁺(g) → M⁺(aq) (hydration). The hydration step releases energy (hydration
    enthalpy), and this energy is inversely proportional to ionic size. Li⁺ (smallest)
    has the highest hydration enthalpy (-520 kJ/mol), which more than compensates
    for its high ionization energy. Therefore, Li becomes the strongest reducer in
    aqueous solution: Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs. This reversal is unique to aqueous media.'
