  \ 1 - Alkali Metals\n\n    ## Introduction\n\n    Group 1 elements are called **alkali\
  \ metals** because they form alkalis (strong bases) when they react with water.\n\
  \n    **Members:** Lithium (Li), Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Rubidium (Rb), Cesium\
  \ (Cs), Francium (Fr)\n\n    ## Electronic Configuration\n\n    All alkali metals\
  \ have **one valence electron** in their outermost s-orbital.\n\n    - Li: [He]\
  \ 2s¹\n    - Na: [Ne] 3s¹\n    - K: [Ar] 4s¹\n    - Rb: [Kr] 5s¹\n    - Cs: [Xe]\
  \ 6s¹\n    - Fr: [Rn] 7s¹\n\n    This single valence electron makes them highly\
  \ reactive and gives them similar chemical properties.\n\n    ## Physical Properties\n\
  \n    ### Atomic and Ionic Radii\n    - **Increase down the group:** Li < Na < K\
  \ < Rb < Cs < Fr\n    - Reason: Addition of new electron shells\n    - Alkali metals\
  \ have the **largest atomic radii** in their respective periods\n\n    ### Ionization\
  \ Energy (IE)\n    - **Decreases down the group:** Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs > Fr\n\
  \    - Reason: Increasing atomic size, valence electron farther from nucleus\n \
  \   - Alkali metals have the **lowest ionization energies** in their periods\n \
  \   - Easy to lose the valence electron → +1 oxidation state\n\n    ### Electronegativity\n\
  \    - **Decreases down the group:** Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs > Fr\n    - Very low\
  \ electronegativity (highly electropositive)\n\n    ### Density\n    - Generally\
  \ **increases down the group**\n    - Exception: K < Na (due to large increase in\
  \ atomic size)\n    - Li, Na, K are less dense than water\n\n    ### Melting and\
  \ Boiling Points\n    - **Decrease down the group:** Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs > Fr\n\
  \    - Reason: Weaker metallic bonding with increasing size\n    - Alkali metals\
  \ are soft and have low melting points\n\n    ### Physical State and Appearance\n\
  \    - All are soft, silvery-white metals\n    - Can be cut with a knife\n    -\
  \ Freshly cut surface is shiny but tarnishes quickly in air\n\n    ## Chemical Properties\n\
  \n    ### 1. Reaction with Oxygen\n\n    All alkali metals react vigorously with\
  \ oxygen, but products differ:\n\n    **Lithium (Normal oxide):**\n    4Li + O₂\
  \ → 2Li₂O (Lithium oxide)\n\n    **Sodium (Peroxide):**\n    2Na + O₂ → Na₂O₂ (Sodium\
  \ peroxide)\n\n    **K, Rb, Cs (Superoxide):**\n    K + O₂ → KO₂ (Potassium superoxide)\n\
  \n    **Trend:** Normal oxide → Peroxide → Superoxide (down the group)\n\n    ###\
  \ 2. Reaction with Water\n\n    All alkali metals react with water to form hydroxides\
  \ and hydrogen gas:\n\n    2M + 2H₂O → 2MOH + H₂↑\n\n    **Reactivity increases\
  \ down the group:** Li < Na < K < Rb < Cs\n\n    - Li: Reacts steadily, floats\n\
  \    - Na: Reacts vigorously, melts into a ball, floats\n    - K: Reacts violently,\
  \ catches fire (lilac flame), floats\n    - Rb, Cs: Explosive reaction\n\n    ###\
  \ 3. Reaction with Halogens\n\n    Form ionic halides (MX):\n\n    2M + X₂ → 2MX\n\
  \n    - Highly exothermic reactions\n    - Reactivity: F₂ > Cl₂ > Br₂ > I₂\n\n \
  \   ### 4. Reaction with Hydrogen\n\n    Form ionic hydrides (MH):\n\n    2M + H₂\
  \ → 2MH (at high temperature)\n\n    - These are strong reducing agents\n    - Example:\
  \ LiH, NaH\n\n    ### 5. Reducing Nature\n\n    Alkali metals are **strong reducing\
  \ agents**.\n\n    **Reducing power:** Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs (in aqueous solution)\n\
  \n    **Why is Li the strongest reducer?**\n    - High hydration enthalpy due to\
  \ small size\n    - Compensates for high ionization energy\n\n    ## Flame Colors\n\
  \n    Alkali metals impart characteristic colors to flame:\n\n    | Element | Flame\
  \ Color | Wavelength Range |\n    |---------|-------------|------------------|\n\
  \    | Li | Crimson red | 670 nm |\n    | Na | Golden yellow | 589 nm |\n    | K\
  \ | Lilac/Violet | 766 nm |\n    | Rb | Red-violet | - |\n    | Cs | Blue | - |\n\
  \n    **Reason:** Excitation of valence electron by heat energy\n\n    ## Solutions\
  \ in Liquid Ammonia\n\n    Alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia to form blue\
  \ solutions:\n\n    M + (x+y)NH₃ → [M(NH₃)ₓ]⁺ + [e(NH₃)ᵧ]⁻\n\n    - Dilute solutions:\
  \ Blue color (due to ammoniated electrons)\n    - Concentrated solutions: Bronze\
  \ color (metallic luster)\n    - Solutions are good conductors of electricity\n\
  \    - Paramagnetic due to unpaired electrons\n\n    ## Anomalous Properties of\
  \ Lithium\n\n    Lithium differs from other alkali metals due to its **small size**\
  \ and **high charge density**:\n\n    1. **Hardest** alkali metal\n    2. **Highest\
  \ melting and boiling points**\n    3. **Least reactive** with water\n    4. Forms\
  \ **covalent compounds** (e.g., LiCl has some covalent character)\n    5. **Decomposes\
  \ on heating:** 4LiNO₃ → 2Li₂O + 4NO₂ + O₂ (other alkali metal nitrates give nitrites)\n\
  \    6. **LiOH is less basic** than other alkali metal hydroxides\n    7. **Li₂CO₃\
  \ decomposes on heating** (others don't)\n    8. **Does not form superoxide** (only\
  \ normal oxide)\n\n    ## Diagonal Relationship: Li and Mg\n\n    Lithium shows\
  \ similarity with Magnesium (diagonal element) due to similar charge/size ratio:\n\
  \n    | Property | Similarity |\n    |----------|-----------|\n    | Hardness |\
  \ Both are harder than group members |\n    | Carbonate | Both carbonates decompose\
  \ on heating |\n    | Nitrate | Both nitrates give oxides on heating |\n    | Hydroxide\
  \ | Both hydroxides are weak bases |\n    | Bicarbonate | Neither forms solid bicarbonates\
  \ |\n    | Organometallic | Both form organometallic compounds |\n\n    ## Important\
