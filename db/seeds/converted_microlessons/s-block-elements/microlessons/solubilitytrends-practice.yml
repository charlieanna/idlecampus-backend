  Solubility of sulfates DECREASES down the group: BaSO₄ < SrSO₄ < CaSO₄ < MgSO₄ <
  BeSO₄. BaSO₄ is almost insoluble (used in barium meal for X-rays).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which alkaline earth metal sulfate is almost insoluble in water?
  options:
  - MgSO₄
  - CaSO₄
  - SrSO₄
  - BaSO₄
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: BaSO₄
  explanation: 'BaSO₄ (barium sulfate) is almost insoluble in water (Ksp = 1.1 ×
    10⁻¹⁰). The solubility of alkaline earth metal sulfates decreases down the group:
    BeSO₄ > MgSO₄ > CaSO₄ > SrSO₄ > BaSO₄. This trend is opposite to that of hydroxides.
    MgSO₄ is highly soluble (Epsom salt), CaSO₄ is sparingly soluble (gypsum), and
    BaSO₄ is virtually insoluble. The decreasing solubility is because: (1) Lattice
    enthalpy decreases slowly (as both cation and anion are large), (2) Hydration
    enthalpy decreases rapidly down the group (larger cations are less hydrated).
    Since lattice enthalpy dominates, solubility decreases. BaSO₄''s insolubility
    makes it useful for: (1) Barium meal in medical X-rays (opaque to X-rays, safe
    despite Ba²⁺ toxicity), (2) White pigment in paints.'

  question: How does the solubility of alkaline earth metal hydroxides vary down the
    group?
  options:
  - Solubility decreases down the group
  - Solubility increases down the group
  - Solubility remains constant
  - First increases then decreases
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Solubility increases down the group
  explanation: 'The solubility of alkaline earth metal hydroxides increases down
    the group: Be(OH)₂ < Mg(OH)₂ < Ca(OH)₂ < Sr(OH)₂ < Ba(OH)₂. This trend is opposite
    to sulfates. Be(OH)₂ is amphoteric and sparingly soluble, Mg(OH)₂ is only slightly
    soluble (milk of magnesia), Ca(OH)₂ is moderately soluble (lime water, used to
    test for CO₂), while Ba(OH)₂ is highly soluble. The increasing solubility occurs
    because: (1) Lattice enthalpy decreases more rapidly than hydration enthalpy
    down the group (OH⁻ is small, so lattice energy decreases significantly with
    larger cations), (2) The energy required to break the crystal lattice becomes
    smaller. This makes dissolution more favorable for larger cations. The high solubility
    and strong basicity of Ba(OH)₂ makes it useful in analytical chemistry and as
    a reagent.'
