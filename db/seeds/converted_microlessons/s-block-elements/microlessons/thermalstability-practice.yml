  Thermal stability of carbonates INCREASES down the group: BeCO₃ < MgCO₃ < CaCO₃
  < SrCO₃ < BaCO₃. Smaller cations have higher polarizing power, making the carbonate
  more unstable.

  question: 'Arrange the following carbonates in order of INCREASING thermal stability:
    BeCO₃, MgCO₃, CaCO₃, BaCO₃'
  require_pass: true
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 2
  question: Why does thermal stability of carbonates increase down Group 2?
  options:
  - Larger cations have lower polarizing power
  - Larger cations form stronger bonds
  - Decomposition temperature decreases down the group
  - Carbonate ion becomes more stable
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Larger cations have lower polarizing power
  explanation: 'Thermal stability of carbonates increases down Group 2 (BeCO₃ <
    MgCO₃ < CaCO₃ < SrCO₃ < BaCO₃) because larger cations have lower polarizing power.
    The explanation: (1) Polarizing power = charge/size. Smaller cations (Be²⁺, Mg²⁺)
    have high charge density and high polarizing power. (2) High polarizing power
    weakens the C-O bonds in the carbonate ion (CO₃²⁻), making it easier to decompose:
    MCO₃ → MO + CO₂. (3) Larger cations (Ba²⁺, Sr²⁺) have lower polarizing power,
    so they don''t distort the carbonate ion as much, making it more thermally stable.
    BeCO₃ is so unstable it only exists in solution, not as a solid. Decomposition
    temperatures: MgCO₃ (~540°C) < CaCO₃ (~900°C) < SrCO₃ (~1280°C) < BaCO₃ (~1360°C).
    This trend also applies to nitrates.'

  question: How does the thermal stability of nitrates vary down Group 2?
  options:
  - Stability decreases down the group
  - Stability increases down the group
  - Stability remains constant
  - No clear trend exists
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Stability increases down the group
  explanation: 'The thermal stability of nitrates increases down Group 2, following
    the same trend as carbonates. Nitrates decompose as: 2M(NO₃)₂ → 2MO + 4NO₂ +
    O₂. The stability order is: Be(NO₃)₂ < Mg(NO₃)₂ < Ca(NO₃)₂ < Sr(NO₃)₂ < Ba(NO₃)₂.
    The reason is the same as for carbonates - smaller cations have higher polarizing
    power, which weakens the N-O bonds in the nitrate ion (NO₃⁻), making decomposition
    easier. Be²⁺ has such high polarizing power that Be(NO₃)₂ decomposes at a much
    lower temperature. Larger Ba²⁺ ions cause less distortion of the nitrate ion,
    requiring higher temperatures to decompose. This trend is consistent across Group
    2 and is explained by Fajan''s rules regarding ionic and covalent character. Decomposition
    requires breaking the M-O-N bonds, which becomes harder with less polarization.'
