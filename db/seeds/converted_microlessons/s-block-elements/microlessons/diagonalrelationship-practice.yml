  Be and Al show diagonal relationship. Both BeO and Al₂O₃ are amphoteric, both BeCl₂
  and AlCl₃ are covalent and hygroscopic. Be does not react with water, and Be forms
  [Be(H₂O)₄]²⁺, not 6-coordinate.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Beryllium shows diagonal relationship with aluminium. Which properties
    are similar?
  options:
  - Both oxides are amphoteric
  - Both chlorides are covalent and hygroscopic
  - Both react vigorously with water
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Both chlorides are covalent and hygroscopic
  explanation: 'Beryllium (Be) and Aluminum (Al) show a diagonal relationship - elements
    diagonally positioned in the periodic table have similar properties. Similarities
    include: (1) Both BeCl₂ and AlCl₃ are covalent (not ionic) due to high polarizing
    power of small, highly charged cations (Be²⁺ and Al³⁺). (2) Both chlorides are
    hygroscopic (absorb moisture from air) and fume in moist air. (3) Both oxides
    (BeO and Al₂O₃) are amphoteric - reacting with both acids and bases. (4) Both
    form covalent organometallic compounds. The relationship arises because Be²⁺ and
    Al³⁺ have similar charge/radius ratios, leading to similar polarizing power. Be
    does NOT react vigorously with water (unlike Mg), making option 3 incorrect.'

  question: Why does beryllium show diagonal relationship with aluminium rather than
    with magnesium?
  options:
  - They have the same number of valence electrons
  - They have similar charge-to-radius ratios
  - They are in the same period
  - They have the same electronegativity
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: They have similar charge-to-radius ratios
  explanation: 'Beryllium shows diagonal relationship with aluminium because they
    have similar charge-to-radius (charge density) ratios, leading to similar polarizing
    power. The diagonal relationship occurs when: (1) Moving down a group increases
    ionic size, (2) Moving right across a period also increases charge but decreases
    size. These effects partially cancel diagonally. For Be²⁺ and Al³⁺: charge/radius
    ratios are similar (~6.5 for Be²⁺, ~6.0 for Al³⁺), resulting in similar properties.
    Similarities: BeCl₂ and AlCl₃ are covalent; BeO and Al₂O₃ are amphoteric; both
    form protective oxide layers; both form [M(H₂O)₄]ⁿ⁺ complexes. In contrast, Mg²⁺
    has a much lower charge density, making its compounds more ionic. Other diagonal
    relationships: Li-Mg, B-Si.'

  question: Which pair of elements also exhibits diagonal relationship?
  options:
  - Sodium and Calcium
  - Lithium and Magnesium
  - Boron and Nitrogen
  - Carbon and Phosphorus
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Lithium and Magnesium
  explanation: 'Lithium and Magnesium exhibit diagonal relationship. Diagonal relationships
    occur between elements in the second and third periods of adjacent groups due
    to similar charge density. The main diagonal pairs are: (1) Li (Group 1) and
    Mg (Group 2), (2) Be (Group 2) and Al (Group 13), (3) B (Group 13) and Si (Group
    14). Li-Mg similarities: both form normal oxides (Li₂O, MgO), not peroxides or
    superoxides; both have low solubility of carbonates, fluorides, and phosphates;
    LiCl and MgCl₂ are deliquescent; both form covalent organometallic compounds;
    Li and Mg do not form solid bicarbonates. The similar charge/radius ratio of
    Li⁺ (~1.5) and Mg²⁺ (~3.0 but considering +2 charge, effective ~1.5) leads to
    these similarities. This pattern does not extend beyond the second period effectively.'
