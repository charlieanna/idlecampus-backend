  question: Which alkaline earth metal gives an apple green flame?
  options:
  - Calcium
  - Strontium
  - Barium
  - Magnesium
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Barium
  explanation: 'Barium (Ba) gives an apple green (or green) flame color. Flame tests
    are used to identify alkaline earth metals based on their characteristic colors
    due to electronic transitions: Calcium (Ca) - brick red/orange-red, Strontium
    (Sr) - crimson red/scarlet, Barium (Ba) - apple green/pale green, Magnesium (Mg)
    and Beryllium (Be) - no distinctive flame color (Mg burns with intense white light).
    When heated, metal ions absorb energy, exciting electrons to higher energy levels.
    When electrons return to ground state, they emit light of specific wavelengths
    corresponding to the energy difference, producing characteristic colors. This
    is the basis of fireworks and analytical flame tests.'

  question: What flame color does calcium produce in a flame test?
  options:
  - Crimson red
  - Brick red
  - Apple green
  - Golden yellow
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Brick red
  explanation: 'Calcium produces a brick red (or orange-red) flame color. Flame colors
    for s-block elements: Group 1 (Alkali metals): Li - crimson/carmine red, Na -
    golden yellow (most intense), K - lilac/violet, Rb - red-violet, Cs - blue-violet.
    Group 2 (Alkaline earth metals): Ca - brick red/orange-red, Sr - crimson red/scarlet,
    Ba - apple green/pale green, Be/Mg - no distinctive color. The flame test works
    because: (1) Heat energy excites valence electrons to higher energy levels, (2)
    Electrons quickly fall back to ground state, (3) Energy is released as light
    of specific wavelength (color), (4) The wavelength depends on the energy gap,
    which is characteristic for each element. Flame tests are used in qualitative
    analysis to identify metal ions in unknown samples.'

  question: Why do alkali and alkaline earth metals produce colored flames?
  options:
  - They burn at very high temperatures
  - Electrons undergo transitions between energy levels
  - They react with oxygen in the flame
  - They emit thermal radiation
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Electrons undergo transitions between energy levels
  explanation: 'Alkali and alkaline earth metals produce colored flames because their
    electrons undergo transitions between discrete energy levels. The mechanism: (1)
    Heat from the flame provides energy to excite valence electrons from ground state
    to higher energy levels (excited state), (2) These excited states are unstable,
    so electrons quickly return to the ground state, (3) Energy is released as electromagnetic
    radiation (light) with wavelength λ = hc/ΔE, where ΔE is the energy difference
    between levels, (4) The specific wavelength corresponds to a visible color characteristic
    of that element. Each element has unique energy level spacings, producing unique
    colors. This is an atomic emission spectrum. The same principle is used in fireworks
    (strontium salts for red, barium for green, sodium for yellow, copper for blue).
    Not all metals show flame colors - transition metals typically don''t because
    they have multiple closely spaced d-orbitals.'
