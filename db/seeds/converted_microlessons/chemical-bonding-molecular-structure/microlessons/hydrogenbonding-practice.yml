  TRUE. Hydrogen bonding requires H bonded to highly electronegative atoms (F, O,
  N) which create significant partial positive charge on H.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Hydrogen bonding can only occur when hydrogen is bonded to F, O, or N. Is this statement true or false?
  options:
  - True
  - False
  - Only true for F and O
  - Only true for organic compounds
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: True
  explanation: 'TRUE. Hydrogen bonding requires hydrogen to be covalently bonded to highly electronegative atoms: fluorine (F), oxygen (O), or nitrogen (N). These three elements have electronegativity values > 3.0 (F: 4.0, O: 3.5, N: 3.0), which creates a significant partial positive charge (δ+) on the hydrogen atom. This highly polar H-F, H-O, or H-N bond allows the hydrogen to be attracted to lone pairs on nearby F, O, or N atoms, forming hydrogen bonds (represented as H···F, H···O, or H···N). Examples: H₂O has O-H···O hydrogen bonds, NH₃ has N-H···N bonds, HF has F-H···F bonds. Other elements like Cl, S, or C are not electronegative enough to create the necessary polarity for hydrogen bonding, though they can participate in weaker dipole-dipole interactions.'

  question: Which of the following molecules can form hydrogen bonds with water?
  options:
  - CH₄ (methane)
  - CH₃OH (methanol)
  - CCl₄ (carbon tetrachloride)
  - C₆H₁₄ (hexane)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: CH₃OH (methanol)
  explanation: 'CH₃OH (methanol) can form hydrogen bonds with water because it contains an O-H group. The oxygen in methanol has lone pairs that can accept hydrogen bonds from water''s H atoms, and methanol''s H atom (bonded to O) can donate hydrogen bonds to water''s oxygen lone pairs. This results in methanol being completely miscible with water. Structure: CH₃-OH where the -OH group makes it an alcohol. In contrast: CH₄ (methane) has only C-H bonds with insufficient polarity, CCl₄ is nonpolar despite having polar C-Cl bonds (symmetry cancels dipoles), and C₆H₁₄ (hexane) is a nonpolar hydrocarbon. For hydrogen bonding with water, molecules need H-F, H-O, or H-N groups to act as donors or F, O, N atoms with lone pairs to act as acceptors.'

  question: Why does water have an unusually high boiling point (100°C) compared to H₂S (-60°C), despite H₂S having a higher molecular weight?
  options:
  - Water has stronger London dispersion forces
  - Water molecules are smaller
  - Water forms extensive hydrogen bonding networks
  - H₂S is a gas at room temperature
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Water forms extensive hydrogen bonding networks
  explanation: 'Water has a much higher boiling point (100°C) than H₂S (-60°C) because water forms extensive hydrogen bonding networks, while H₂S cannot form hydrogen bonds. In H₂O, oxygen (electronegativity 3.5) creates highly polar O-H bonds, allowing each water molecule to form up to 4 hydrogen bonds (2 as donor through H atoms, 2 as acceptor through O lone pairs). This creates a strong intermolecular network requiring significant energy to break during boiling. In H₂S, sulfur (electronegativity 2.5) is not electronegative enough to create the polarity needed for hydrogen bonding; H₂S only has weak dipole-dipole and London forces. Despite H₂S having higher molecular weight (34 g/mol vs 18 g/mol for H₂O), which would typically increase London forces, hydrogen bonding in water dominates. This explains why water is liquid at room temperature while H₂S is a gas.'
