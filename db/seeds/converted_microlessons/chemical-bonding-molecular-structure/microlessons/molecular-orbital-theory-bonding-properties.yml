  \ Orbital Theory & Bonding Properties\n\n    ## Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT)\n\
  \n    **Concept:** Atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals that belong\
  \ to the entire molecule\n\n    ### Key Principles:\n\n    1. **Number of MOs =\
  \ Number of AOs** combined\n    2. Two types: **Bonding** (lower energy) and **Antibonding**\
  \ (higher energy)\n    3. Electrons fill MOs according to aufbau principle\n   \
  \ 4. **Bonding MO:** Electron density between nuclei (stabilizes)\n    5. **Antibonding\
  \ MO:** Electron density away from internuclear region (destabilizes)\n\n    ##\
  \ Formation of Molecular Orbitals\n\n    ### Bonding MO (σ):\n    - Formed by **constructive\
  \ interference** of atomic orbitals\n    - **Lower energy** than atomic orbitals\n\
  \    - Electron density **concentrated between nuclei**\n    - Denoted: σ, π\n\n\
  \    ### Antibonding MO (σ*):\n    - Formed by **destructive interference**\n  \
  \  - **Higher energy** than atomic orbitals\n    - Electron density **away from\
  \ nuclei**\n    - Denoted: σ*, π*\n\n    ## Energy Order of Molecular Orbitals\n\
  \n    ### For O₂, F₂, Ne₂:\n    σ1s < σ*1s < σ2s < σ*2s < σ2pz < π2px = π2py < π*2px\
  \ = π*2py < σ*2pz\n\n    ### For B₂, C₂, N₂:\n    σ1s < σ*1s < σ2s < σ*2s < π2px\
  \ = π2py < σ2pz < π*2px = π*2py < σ*2pz\n\n    **Note:** For B₂ to N₂, π2p orbitals\
  \ are lower in energy than σ2pz\n\n    ## Bond Order\n\n    **Formula:**\n    **Bond\
  \ Order = (Nb - Na)/2**\n\n    Where:\n    - Nb = number of electrons in bonding\
  \ MOs\n    - Na = number of electrons in antibonding MOs\n\n    **Interpretation:**\n\
  \    - Bond order = 0 → molecule doesn't exist\n    - Bond order = 1 → single bond\n\
  \    - Bond order = 2 → double bond\n    - Bond order = 3 → triple bond\n    - Higher\
  \ bond order → stronger bond, shorter length\n\n    ## Molecular Orbital Diagrams\n\

  question: "What is the bond order and magnetic nature of O₂⁺ ion?"
  options:
  - "Bond order = 2.0, Diamagnetic"
  - "Bond order = 2.5, Paramagnetic"
  - "Bond order = 1.5, Paramagnetic"
  - "Bond order = 2.5, Diamagnetic"
  correct_answer: "Bond order = 2.5, Paramagnetic"
  explanation: "To determine the bond order and magnetic nature of O₂⁺, we need to apply Molecular Orbital Theory. O₂ has 16 electrons, so O₂⁺ has 15 electrons after losing one electron. The electronic configuration is: σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² σ2pz² π2px² π2py² π*2px¹ π*2py⁰. The electron is removed from the antibonding π* orbital. Using the formula Bond Order = (Nb - Na)/2, where Nb = number of bonding electrons and Na = number of antibonding electrons: Nb = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10 electrons in bonding orbitals; Na = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 electrons in antibonding orbitals. Therefore, Bond Order = (10 - 5)/2 = 2.5. Since there is one unpaired electron in the π*2px orbital, O₂⁺ is paramagnetic (attracted to a magnetic field). Interestingly, O₂⁺ has a higher bond order than O₂ (which has bond order 2.0), making it more stable with a shorter, stronger bond. This superoxide ion is important in atmospheric chemistry and biological systems."

  question: "Which of the following molecules is correctly predicted to be paramagnetic by Molecular Orbital Theory?"
  options:
  - "N₂"
  - "F₂"
  - "B₂"
  - "C₂"
  correct_answer: "B₂"
  explanation: "Molecular Orbital Theory successfully predicts the magnetic properties of diatomic molecules, which is one of its major advantages over Valence Bond Theory. A molecule is paramagnetic if it has unpaired electrons. Let's analyze each option: (1) N₂ has 14 electrons with configuration σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² π2px² π2py² σ2pz² - all electrons are paired, making it diamagnetic; (2) F₂ has 18 electrons, all paired in its molecular orbitals, making it diamagnetic; (3) B₂ has 10 electrons with configuration σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² π2px¹ π2py¹ - the two electrons in the degenerate π2p orbitals remain unpaired following Hund's rule, making B₂ paramagnetic; (4) C₂ has 12 electrons with all paired, making it diamagnetic. The paramagnetism of B₂ was experimentally confirmed and provides strong evidence for MOT. The bond order of B₂ is (6-4)/2 = 1, indicating a single bond. This demonstrates how MOT can explain magnetic properties that VBT cannot predict."

  question: "Why is CO₂ non-polar (μ = 0) while H₂O is polar (μ = 1.85 D), even though both contain polar bonds?"
  options:
  - "C-O bonds are non-polar while O-H bonds are polar"
  - "CO₂ is linear and bond dipoles cancel; H₂O is bent and dipoles add vectorially"
  - "CO₂ has no lone pairs while H₂O has lone pairs"
  - "Carbon is less electronegative than hydrogen"
  correct_answer: "CO₂ is linear and bond dipoles cancel; H₂O is bent and dipoles add vectorially"
  explanation: "The dipole moment of a molecule depends not only on the polarity of individual bonds but also on the molecular geometry, which determines whether bond dipoles cancel or add up. CO₂ has the structure O=C=O with a linear geometry (bond angle 180°). Each C=O bond is polar (ΔEN = 1.0), but because the molecule is perfectly linear, the two bond dipole vectors are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, resulting in complete cancellation and a net dipole moment of zero. In contrast, H₂O has a bent geometry (bond angle 104.5°) due to the two lone pairs on oxygen. The two O-H bonds are polar (ΔEN = 1.4), and because of the bent shape, the bond dipole vectors do not cancel but instead add vectorially to give a net dipole moment of 1.85 D pointing from the hydrogen atoms toward the oxygen. The bent geometry arises from VSEPR theory: the four electron pairs (2 bonding, 2 lone pairs) arrange themselves tetrahedrally to minimize repulsion, but we observe only the atoms in a bent shape. This principle applies to many molecules: symmetric molecules like CH₄, CCl₄, BF₃ have μ = 0, while asymmetric molecules like NH₃, HCl have μ ≠ 0."
