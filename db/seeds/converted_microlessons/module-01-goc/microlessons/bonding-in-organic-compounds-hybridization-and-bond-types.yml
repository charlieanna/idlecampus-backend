  \n    ### What is Hybridization?\n    **Hybridization** is the mixing of atomic\
  \ orbitals to form new **hybrid orbitals** suitable for bonding.\n\n    ### Types\
  \ of Hybridization\n\n    #### sp³ Hybridization (Tetrahedral)\n    - **Formation:**\
  \ 1s + 3p orbitals → 4 sp³ hybrid orbitals\n    - **Geometry:** Tetrahedral\n  \
  \  - **Bond angle:** 109.5°\n    - **Examples:** CH₄ (methane), C₂H₆ (ethane), diamond\n\
  \    - **Carbon valency:** 4 single bonds\n\n    ```\n    CH₄ (Methane):\n     \
  \    H\n         |\n    H — C — H    Bond angle: 109.5°\n         |\n         H\n\

  \ pi bonds (triple bond)\n\n    ```\n    C₂H₂ (Ethyne):\n    H — C ≡ C — H    Bond\
  \ angle: 180°\n\n    Triple bond = 1 σ (sigma) + 2 π (pi)\n    ```\n\n    ### Summary\

  \ Bonds\n\n    ### Sigma (σ) Bond\n    - **Formation:** Head-on overlap of orbitals\n\
  \    - **Electron density:** Along the internuclear axis\n    - **Rotation:** Free\
  \ rotation possible\n    - **Strength:** Stronger than pi bond\n    - **Examples:**\
  \ All single bonds (C-C, C-H, C-O, etc.)\n\n    ### Pi (π) Bond\n    - **Formation:**\
  \ Lateral (sideways) overlap of p orbitals\n    - **Electron density:** Above and\
  \ below the internuclear axis\n    - **Rotation:** Restricted (no free rotation)\n\
  \    - **Strength:** Weaker than sigma bond\n    - **Examples:** Present in double\
  \ and triple bonds\n\n    ### Key Differences\n\n    | Property | Sigma (σ) Bond\
  \ | Pi (π) Bond |\n    |----------|----------------|-------------|\n    | **Overlap**\
  \ | Head-on | Lateral |\n    | **Strength** | Stronger | Weaker |\n    | **Rotation**\

  \ Bond Composition\n    - **Single bond (C-C):** 1σ\n    - **Double bond (C=C):**\
  \ 1σ + 1π\n    - **Triple bond (C≡C):** 1σ + 2π\n\n    ---\n\n    ## 3. Bond Length\
  \ and Bond Energy\n\n    ### Bond Length\n    **Bond length** is the average distance\
  \ between the nuclei of two bonded atoms.\n\n    **Order of bond length:**\n   \
  \ ```\n    C ≡ C  <  C = C  <  C — C\n    (shortest)          (longest)\n\n    120\
  \ pm < 134 pm < 154 pm\n    ```\n\n    **Reason:** More bonds → more attraction\
  \ → shorter distance\n\n    ### Bond Energy (Bond Strength)\n    **Bond energy**\
  \ is the energy required to break one mole of bonds in the gaseous state.\n\n  \
  \  **Order of bond strength:**\n    ```\n    C ≡ C  >  C = C  >  C — C\n    (strongest)\
  \       (weakest)\n\n    839 kJ/mol > 606 kJ/mol > 347 kJ/mol\n    ```\n\n    **Important\
  \ relationship:**\n    - **Bond length ∝ 1 / Bond strength**\n    - Shorter bond\
  \ = Stronger bond\n    - Longer bond = Weaker bond\n\n    ---\n\n    ## 4. Percentage\

  \ 25% s-character (1s out of 4 orbitals)\n    - **sp²:** 33% s-character (1s out\
  \ of 3 orbitals)\n    - **sp:** 50% s-character (1s out of 2 orbitals)\n\n    ###\

  \ > 109.5° (sp³)\n\n    #### Electronegativity Increases\n    - More s-character\
  \ → Electrons held more tightly\n    - **Order:** sp > sp² > sp³ (electronegativity)\n\
  \n    #### Acidity Increases\n    - More s-character → Anion more stable → More\
  \ acidic\n    - **Acidity order:** HC≡CH > H₂C=CH₂ > H₃C-CH₃\n    - **pKa values:**\
  \ 25 > 44 > 50\n\n    ---\n\n    ## 5. Covalent Character and Polarity\n\n    ###\
  \ Electronegativity and Bond Polarity\n    - **Electronegativity difference (ΔEN)**\
  \ determines bond character\n    - Larger ΔEN → More polar bond\n\n    ### Bond\
  \ Types\n    | ΔEN | Bond Type | Example |\n    |-----|-----------|---------|\n\
  \    | 0 - 0.4 | Nonpolar covalent | C-C, C-H |\n    | 0.4 - 1.7 | Polar covalent\

  question: "What is the hybridization and bond angle of the carbon atom in acetylene (C₂H₂)?"
  options:
  - "sp² hybridization, 120° bond angle"
  - "sp hybridization, 180° bond angle"
  - "sp³ hybridization, 109.5° bond angle"
  - "sp hybridization, 120° bond angle"
  correct_answer: "sp hybridization, 180° bond angle"
  explanation: "In acetylene (HC≡CH), each carbon atom forms a triple bond with the other carbon and a single bond with hydrogen. The triple bond consists of one sigma bond and two pi bonds. For this linear arrangement, the carbon atoms undergo sp hybridization, where one s orbital and one p orbital mix to form two sp hybrid orbitals, leaving two unhybridized p orbitals for forming the two pi bonds. The sp hybridized carbon has a linear geometry with a 180° bond angle, placing the two sigma bonds (C-C and C-H) in a straight line. This is the smallest bond angle among the three main types of hybridization. The sp hybridization provides 50% s-character, which makes the C-H bond in acetylene shorter and stronger than in ethylene (sp²) or ethane (sp³). Additionally, the high s-character makes acetylene relatively acidic (pKa ≈ 25) compared to other hydrocarbons, as the sp hybridized carbon can better stabilize the negative charge when deprotonated."

  question: "Which statement correctly describes the difference between sigma (σ) and pi (π) bonds?"
  options:
  - "Sigma bonds are formed by lateral overlap while pi bonds are formed by head-on overlap"
  - "Pi bonds are stronger than sigma bonds and allow free rotation"
  - "Sigma bonds are formed by head-on overlap and are stronger than pi bonds which are formed by lateral overlap"
  - "Both sigma and pi bonds allow free rotation around the bond axis"
  correct_answer: "Sigma bonds are formed by head-on overlap and are stronger than pi bonds which are formed by lateral overlap"
  explanation: "Sigma (σ) and pi (π) bonds differ fundamentally in their formation and properties. Sigma bonds form through head-on (axial) overlap of atomic orbitals, creating cylindrical electron density along the internuclear axis. This extensive overlap makes sigma bonds stronger than pi bonds. Pi bonds form through lateral (sideways) overlap of parallel p orbitals, creating electron density above and below the internuclear axis in a dumbbell shape. This lateral overlap is less effective than head-on overlap, making pi bonds weaker. A crucial difference is rotational freedom: sigma bonds allow free rotation because the cylindrical electron cloud maintains overlap during rotation, while pi bonds restrict rotation because rotating would break the lateral overlap. This restriction explains why molecules with double bonds (one σ + one π) show geometric isomerism (cis-trans), while single bonds (one σ only) do not. In practice, every bond has at least one sigma bond: single bonds have one σ, double bonds have one σ and one π, and triple bonds have one σ and two π bonds."

  question: "How does increasing s-character in hybrid orbitals affect the acidity of hydrocarbons?"
  options:
  - "Decreasing s-character increases acidity"
  - "s-character has no effect on acidity"
  - "Increasing s-character increases acidity"
  - "Only p-character affects acidity"
  correct_answer: "Increasing s-character increases acidity"
  explanation: "The percentage of s-character in hybrid orbitals significantly affects the acidity of organic compounds. As s-character increases (sp > sp² > sp³), the hybrid orbital holds electrons closer to the nucleus because s orbitals are more spherical and concentrated near the nucleus compared to p orbitals. This increased electron-holding ability translates to higher electronegativity for the carbon atom. When a hydrogen is removed as H⁺, the resulting carbanion (negatively charged carbon) is more stable when it has higher s-character because the electrons are held more tightly and closer to the nucleus. This stabilization of the conjugate base makes the acid stronger. Therefore, the acidity order is: HC≡CH (sp, 50% s, pKa ≈ 25) > H₂C=CH₂ (sp², 33% s, pKa ≈ 44) > H₃C-CH₃ (sp³, 25% s, pKa ≈ 50). This is why terminal alkynes are notably acidic compared to other hydrocarbons and can be deprotonated by strong bases like sodium amide (NaNH₂) to form acetylide ions, which are useful nucleophiles in organic synthesis."
