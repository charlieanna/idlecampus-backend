  π bonds: (1) Lateral overlap of p orbitals ✓ (2) Restricted rotation ✓ (3) Weaker
  than σ ✓ (4) Electron density above/below axis, not along it.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following statements about π bonds are correct?
  options:
  - π bonds are formed by lateral overlap of p orbitals
  - π bonds allow free rotation around the bond axis
  - π bonds are weaker than σ bonds
  - π bonds have electron density along the internuclear axis
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: π bonds are weaker than σ bonds
  explanation: 'π (pi) bonds are weaker than σ (sigma) bonds. σ bonds form by head-on
    (end-to-end) overlap of atomic orbitals along internuclear axis, providing maximum
    overlap and strong bonding (C-C σ bond: ~348 kJ/mol). π bonds form by sideways/lateral
    overlap of parallel p orbitals above and below the internuclear axis, with less
    effective overlap and weaker bonding (C-C π bond: ~264 kJ/mol). Consequences:
    (1) Strength: σ > π, so breaking π is easier (e.g., C=C adds reagents more easily
    than C-C), (2) Free rotation around σ bonds, but restricted around π bonds (breaking
    π requires ~264 kJ/mol), (3) First bond between atoms is always σ; second/third
    bonds are π. In C=C: 1σ + 1π (~612 kJ/mol total); in C≡C: 1σ + 2π (~839 kJ/mol
    total).'
