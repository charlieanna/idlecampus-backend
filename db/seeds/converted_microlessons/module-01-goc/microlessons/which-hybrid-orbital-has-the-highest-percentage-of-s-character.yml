  sp has 50% s-character (1s in 2 orbitals). sp² has 33% (1s in 3 orbitals). sp³ has
  25% (1s in 4 orbitals).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which hybrid orbital has the HIGHEST percentage of s-character?
  options:
  - sp³
  - sp²
  - sp
  - All have equal s-character
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: sp
  explanation: 'sp hybrid orbitals have the highest s-character (50% s, 50% p) among
    common hybridizations. Comparison: sp (50% s), sp² (33.3% s), sp³ (25% s), sp³d
    (20% s). Higher s-character means: (1) Shorter, stronger bonds - s orbitals closer
    to nucleus than p, (2) Higher electronegativity of hybridized atom - electrons
    held tighter, (3) Greater bond acidity: sp C-H (pKa ~25 in terminal alkynes) >
    sp² C-H (pKa ~44) > sp³ C-H (pKa ~50), (4) Linear geometry - sp occurs in alkynes
    (C≡C), nitriles (C≡N), CO₂ (O=C=O) with 180° angles. s-character affects properties:
    acetylene (H-C≡C-H) is acidic enough to react with strong bases like NaNH₂ due
    to sp hybridization making the H acidic.'
