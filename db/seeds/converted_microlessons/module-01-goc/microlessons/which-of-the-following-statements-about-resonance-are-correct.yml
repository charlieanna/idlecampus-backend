  question: Which of the following statements about resonance are correct?
  options:
  - Resonance structures differ in the position of electrons only
  - The actual molecule is a hybrid of all resonance structures
  - Atoms can change position in different resonance structures
  - Resonance always increases molecular stability
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Resonance always increases molecular stability
  explanation: 'Resonance always increases molecular stability. The actual structure
    (resonance hybrid) is more stable than any individual resonance contributor -
    this stabilization energy is called resonance energy or delocalization energy.
    Key points: (1) Hybrid has lower energy than any single structure due to electron
    delocalization, (2) Greater number of equivalent resonance structures = greater
    stability (e.g., benzene with 2 equivalent Kekulé structures has high resonance
    energy ~150 kJ/mol), (3) All contributing structures must have same positions
    of atoms, only electrons move, (4) Better (more stable) contributors have: more
    covalent bonds, complete octets, negative charge on more electronegative atom.
    Examples: benzene, carboxylate ions (35 kJ/mol stabilization), carbonate, nitrate.
    Resonance explains why benzoic acid (pKa 4.2) is more acidic than acetic acid
    (pKa 4.8) - benzoate ion has better resonance stabilization.'
