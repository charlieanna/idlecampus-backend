  -OH shows -I (O is electronegative) and +M (lone pair donation). +M dominates, making
  -OH a net electron-donating group. -NO₂, -COOH, -CN show dominant -M effect.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: -OH
  explanation: 'The -OH (hydroxyl) group shows both -I (negative inductive) effect
    and +M (positive mesomeric/resonance) effect, but +M dominates, making -OH a net
    electron-donating, activating group. Explanation: (1) -I effect: Oxygen is more
    electronegative (3.5) than carbon (2.5), withdrawing electrons through σ bonds,
    (2) +M effect: Oxygen''s lone pairs can donate into adjacent π system through
    resonance, strongly donating electrons. Since +M > -I in magnitude, -OH is overall
    strongly activating in EAS (electrophilic aromatic substitution) and directs to
    ortho/para positions. Phenol is 10³ times more reactive than benzene. Similar
    groups: -NH₂ (+M >> -I), -OR, -NHCOR. Contrast with: -NO₂ (-M and -I, strongly
    deactivating), halogens (+M < -I, weakly deactivating).'
