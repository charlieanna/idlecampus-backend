  La³⁺ (f⁰) and Lu³⁺ (f¹⁴) are colorless because they have no f-electrons or fully-filled
  f-orbitals. No f-f transitions are possible. Other Ln³⁺ ions are colored due to
  f-f transitions.


  ## Key Points

  question: Which lanthanoid ions are colorless?
  options:
  - La³⁺ and Lu³⁺
  - Ce³⁺ and Pr³⁺
  - Nd³⁺ and Sm³⁺
  - Eu³⁺ and Gd³⁺
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: La³⁺ and Lu³⁺
  explanation: 'La³⁺ (lanthanum) and Lu³⁺ (lutetium) are the only colorless lanthanoid
    ions because they have extreme f-electron configurations: **La³⁺** has f⁰ configuration
    (no f-electrons at all), so no f-f transitions are possible. **Lu³⁺** has f¹⁴
    configuration (completely filled f-orbitals), so again no f-f transitions are
    possible. All other lanthanoid ions (Ce³⁺ through Yb³⁺) have partially filled
    f-orbitals (f¹ to f¹³) and exhibit colors due to f-f electronic transitions.
    These transitions occur when f-electrons absorb specific wavelengths of visible
    light and get promoted to higher energy f-orbitals. Examples of colored Ln³⁺
    ions: Pr³⁺ (green, f²), Nd³⁺ (lilac, f³), Sm³⁺ (yellow, f⁵), Eu³⁺ (pale pink,
    f⁶), Tb³⁺ (pale pink, f⁸), Er³⁺ (pink, f¹¹). The f-f transitions are Laporte-forbidden,
    making lanthanoid colors pale compared to transition metal colors.'

  question: Why are f-f transitions in lanthanoid ions weaker than d-d transitions
    in transition metal ions?
  options:
  - f-orbitals are more exposed to external fields
  - f-f transitions are Laporte-forbidden (forbidden by selection rules)
  - f-orbitals have higher energy than d-orbitals
  - Lanthanoids have more unpaired electrons
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: f-f transitions are Laporte-forbidden (forbidden by selection rules)
  explanation: 'f-f transitions in lanthanoid ions are weaker than d-d transitions
    because they are Laporte-forbidden by quantum mechanical selection rules. The
    Laporte selection rule states that allowed electronic transitions must involve
    a change in orbital angular momentum quantum number (Δl = ±1). Since f-f transitions
    involve no change in l (both are f-orbitals), they are formally forbidden. However,
    they can occur weakly due to: (1) **Vibrational coupling**: Molecular vibrations
    temporarily distort the symmetry, relaxing selection rules. (2) **Spin-orbit
    coupling**: Mixes states and partially allows transitions. As a result, lanthanoid
    ions show pale, pastel colors with low molar absorptivities (ε ~ 1-10 M⁻¹cm⁻¹),
    whereas transition metal d-d transitions (also formally forbidden but more relaxed)
    have ε ~ 10-100 M⁻¹cm⁻¹. Additionally, f-orbitals are shielded by outer 5s and
    5p electrons, making them less sensitive to the ligand field environment compared
    to exposed d-orbitals in transition metals.'

  question: Which electronic configuration would result in a colored lanthanoid ion?
  options:
  - f⁰ (no f-electrons)
  - f⁷ (half-filled f-orbitals)
  - f¹⁴ (completely filled f-orbitals)
  - Both f⁰ and f¹⁴
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: f⁷ (half-filled f-orbitals)
  explanation: 'An f⁷ configuration (half-filled f-orbitals) results in a colored
    lanthanoid ion because it has partially filled f-orbitals, allowing f-f electronic
    transitions. The f⁷ ion is Gd³⁺ (gadolinium), which actually appears colorless
    in the visible region but can show weak absorption in UV. However, f⁷ demonstrates
    the principle: partially filled f-orbitals (f¹ through f¹³) enable color. Examples
    of colored lanthanoids with partial f-filling: **Pr³⁺ (f²)**: green, **Nd³⁺
    (f³)**: lilac/violet, **Pm³⁺ (f⁴)**: pink (radioactive), **Sm³⁺ (f⁵)**: yellow,
    **Eu³⁺ (f⁶)**: pale pink, **Tb³⁺ (f⁸)**: pale pink, **Dy³⁺ (f⁹)**: yellow, **Ho³⁺
    (f¹⁰)**: yellow, **Er³⁺ (f¹¹)**: pink, **Tm³⁺ (f¹²)**: pale green, **Yb³⁺ (f¹³)**:
    colorless in visible. In contrast: **f⁰ (La³⁺)** and **f¹⁴ (Lu³⁺)** are colorless
    because no f-f transitions are possible with empty or completely filled f-orbitals.'
