  \n    **d-block elements** are elements in which the last electron enters the d-orbital\
  \ of the penultimate (second last) shell.\n\n    **Position in Periodic Table:**\n\
  \    - Groups 3 to 12\n    - Four series: 3d, 4d, 5d, and 6d\n    - Located between\
  \ s-block and p-block elements\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Electronic Configuration\n\n\
  \    ### General Electronic Configuration\n    ```\n    (n-1)d¹⁻¹⁰ ns¹⁻²\n    ```\n\
  \n    Where:\n    - n = outermost shell\n    - (n-1) = penultimate shell\n\n   \
  \ ### 3d Series (Sc to Zn)\n\n    | Element | Atomic No. | Electronic Configuration\
  \ | Exceptional? |\n    |---------|------------|-------------------------|--------------|\n\
  \    | Sc | 21 | [Ar] 3d¹ 4s² | No |\n    | Ti | 22 | [Ar] 3d² 4s² | No |\n    |\
  \ V | 23 | [Ar] 3d³ 4s² | No |\n    | Cr | 24 | [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹ | ✓ Exception |\n \
  \   | Mn | 25 | [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s² | No |\n    | Fe | 26 | [Ar] 3d⁶ 4s² | No |\n    |\
  \ Co | 27 | [Ar] 3d⁷ 4s² | No |\n    | Ni | 28 | [Ar] 3d⁸ 4s² | No |\n    | Cu |\
  \ 29 | [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s¹ | ✓ Exception |\n    | Zn | 30 | [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² | No |\n\n \
  \   **Exceptions:**\n    - **Chromium (Cr):** 3d⁵ 4s¹ (not 3d⁴ 4s²)\n    - **Copper\
  \ (Cu):** 3d¹⁰ 4s¹ (not 3d⁹ 4s²)\n\n    **Reason:** Extra stability of half-filled\
  \ (d⁵) and fully-filled (d¹⁰) orbitals\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Transition Elements\
  \ vs d-Block Elements\n\n    ### Transition Elements\n    **Definition:** Elements\
  \ with **partially filled d-orbitals** in their ground state or common oxidation\
  \ states\n\n    **Includes:**\n    - Sc to Mn (3d¹ to 3d⁵)\n    - Fe to Cu (3d⁶\
  \ to 3d¹⁰)\n\n    **Excludes:**\n    - **Zinc (Zn):** 3d¹⁰ 4s² → Zn²⁺: 3d¹⁰ (fully\
  \ filled d-orbitals)\n    - **Cd, Hg:** Similar reasons\n\n    **Note:** All transition\
  \ elements are d-block elements, but not all d-block elements are transition elements\n\
  \n    ---\n\n    ## General Characteristics of Transition Elements\n\n    ### 1.\
  \ Metallic Character\n    - **All are metals**\n    - High melting and boiling points\
  \ (except Zn, Cd, Hg)\n    - Good conductors of heat and electricity\n    - Hard\
  \ and strong (due to metallic bonding involving d-electrons)\n\n    ### 2. Atomic\
  \ and Ionic Radii\n    - **Decrease across period** (increasing nuclear charge)\n\
  \    - Decrease is small compared to s and p block elements\n    - **Lanthanoid\
  \ contraction** affects 5d series\n\n    ### 3. Ionization Enthalpy\n    - **Increases\
  \ gradually** across the period\n    - Higher than s-block, lower than p-block elements\n\
  \    - **Reason:** Effective nuclear charge increases, shielding by d-electrons\
  \ is less effective\n\n    ### 4. Metallic Character and Density\n    - High density\
  \ (d-electrons contribute to metallic bonding)\n    - **Order:** Osmium (Os) > Iridium\
  \ (Ir) > Platinum (Pt)\n    - **Osmium** is the densest element (22.6 g/cm³)\n\n\
  \    ---\n\n    ## Variable Oxidation States\n\n    **Key Feature:** Transition\
  \ elements show **multiple oxidation states**\n\n    ### Reasons:\n    1. **Small\
  \ energy difference** between (n-1)d and ns orbitals\n    2. Both d and s electrons\
  \ can participate in bonding\n    3. Different numbers of electrons can be lost\n\
  \n    ### Common Oxidation States (3d Series)\n\n    | Element | Common Oxidation\
  \ States | Most Stable |\n    |---------|------------------------|-------------|\n\
  \    | Sc | +3 | +3 |\n    | Ti | +2, +3, +4 | +4 |\n    | V | +2, +3, +4, +5 |\
  \ +5 |\n    | Cr | +2, +3, +6 | +3, +6 |\n    | Mn | +2, +3, +4, +6, +7 | +2, +7\
  \ |\n    | Fe | +2, +3 | +3 |\n    | Co | +2, +3 | +2 |\n    | Ni | +2, +3, +4 |\
  \ +2 |\n    | Cu | +1, +2 | +2 |\n    | Zn | +2 | +2 |\n\n    ### Trends:\n    -\
  \ **Maximum oxidation state** = Group number (up to Mn)\n    - **Higher oxidation\
  \ states** are more common in early transition metals\n    - **+2 oxidation state**\
  \ is most common (loss of 4s² electrons)\n    - **Stability of higher oxidation\
  \ states** decreases across period\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Magnetic Properties\n\n\
  \    ### Paramagnetic vs Diamagnetic\n\n    **Paramagnetic:**\n    - **Unpaired\
  \ electrons** present\n    - Attracted by magnetic field\n    - **Most transition\
  \ metal compounds** are paramagnetic\n\n    **Diamagnetic:**\n    - **No unpaired\
  \ electrons**\n    - Repelled by magnetic field\n    - Examples: Zn²⁺ (3d¹⁰), Cu⁺\
  \ (3d¹⁰), Sc³⁺ (3d⁰)\n\n    ### Magnetic Moment (μ)\n\n    **Formula:**\n    ```\n\
  \    μ = √[n(n+2)] BM (Bohr Magneton)\n    ```\n\n    Where n = number of unpaired\
  \ electrons\n\n    **Examples:**\n    - Fe²⁺ (3d⁶): 4 unpaired electrons → μ = √[4(4+2)]\
  \ = √24 = 4.9 BM\n    - Cu²⁺ (3d⁹): 1 unpaired electron → μ = √[1(1+2)] = √3 = 1.73\
  \ BM\n    - Zn²⁺ (3d¹⁰): 0 unpaired electrons → μ = 0 BM (diamagnetic)\n\n    ---\n\
  \n    ## Formation of Colored Compounds\n\n    **Most transition metal compounds\
  \ are colored**\n\n    ### Reason: d-d Transitions\n    1. **d-orbitals split**\
  \ in the presence of ligands (crystal field splitting)\n    2. **Electrons absorb\
  \ visible light** and jump from lower to higher d-orbitals\n    3. **Complementary\
  \ color** is observed\n\n    ### Examples:\n\n    | Compound | Color | Ion | d-electrons\
  \ |\n    |----------|-------|-----|-------------|\n    | CuSO₄·5H₂O | Blue | Cu²⁺\
  \ | d⁹ |\n    | FeSO₄·7H₂O | Green | Fe²⁺ | d⁶ |\n    | KMnO₄ | Purple | MnO₄⁻ |\
  \ d⁰* |\n    | K₂Cr₂O₇ | Orange | Cr₂O₇²⁻ | d⁰* |\n\n    *MnO₄⁻ and Cr₂O₇²⁻ are\
  \ colored due to charge transfer, not d-d transitions\n\n    ### Colorless Compounds:\n\
  \    - **d⁰ configuration:** Sc³⁺, Ti⁴⁺ (no d-electrons)\n    - **d¹⁰ configuration:**\
  \ Zn²⁺, Cu⁺ (no d-d transitions possible)\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Catalytic Properties\n\
  \n    **Transition metals and their compounds act as excellent catalysts**\n\n \
  \   ### Reasons:\n    1. **Variable oxidation states** - can accept/donate electrons\n\
  \    2. **Large surface area** - provide surface for adsorption\n    3. **Formation\
  \ of intermediate compounds** with reactants\n\n    ### Examples:\n\n    | Catalyst\
  \ | Reaction | Process |\n    |----------|----------|---------|\n    | Fe | N₂ +\
  \ 3H₂ → 2NH₃ | Haber process |\n    | Ni | Vegetable oil + H₂ → Vanaspati | Hydrogenation\
  \ |\n    | V₂O₅ | 2SO₂ + O₂ → 2SO₃ | Contact process |\n    | Pt | 4NH₃ + 5O₂ →\
  \ 4NO + 6H₂O | Ostwald process |\n    | MnO₂ | 2KClO₃ → 2KCl + 3O₂ | Decomposition\
  \ |\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Complex Formation (Coordination Compounds)\n\n    **Transition\
  \ metals readily form complexes**\n\n    ### Reasons:\n    1. **Small size and high\
  \ charge** - high charge density\n    2. **Availability of vacant d-orbitals** for\
  \ accepting electron pairs\n    3. **Variable oxidation states**\n\n    ### Examples:\n\
  \    - [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ - Hexacyanoferrate(II)\n    - [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ - Tetraamminecopper(II)\n\
  \    - [Ni(CO)₄] - Nickel tetracarbonyl\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Interstitial Compounds\n\
  \n    **Compounds formed when small atoms (H, B, C, N) occupy interstitial sites\
  \ in metal lattice**\n\n    ### Properties:\n    - **Non-stoichiometric** (variable\
  \ composition)\n    - **Harder than parent metal**\n    - **Higher melting point**\n\
  \    - **Chemically inert**\n\n    ### Examples:\n    - TiH₁.₇, VH₀.₅₆\n    - TiC,\
  \ Fe₃C (steel)\n    - TiN, Mn₄N\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Alloy Formation\n\n    **Transition\
  \ metals form alloys with each other and with other metals**\n\n    ### Reason:\n\
  \    - Similar atomic sizes\n    - Similar crystal structures\n\n    ### Important\
  \ Alloys:\n    - **Steel:** Fe + C (+ Cr, Ni, etc.)\n    - **Brass:** Cu + Zn\n\
  \    - **Bronze:** Cu + Sn\n    - **Stainless steel:** Fe + Cr + Ni\n\n    ---\n\
  \n    ## IIT JEE Key Points\n\n    1. **Electronic configuration:** (n-1)d¹⁻¹⁰ ns¹⁻²\n\
  \    2. **Exceptions:** Cr (3d⁵ 4s¹), Cu (3d¹⁰ 4s¹) - half-filled and fully-filled\
  \ stability\n    3. **Zn, Cd, Hg are NOT transition elements** (d¹⁰ configuration)\n\
  \    4. **Variable oxidation states** due to close energy of ns and (n-1)d orbitals\n\
  \    5. **Magnetic moment:** μ = √[n(n+2)] BM, where n = unpaired electrons\n  \

  question: "Which of the following electronic configurations is correct for chromium (Cr, Z=24)?"
  options:
  - "[Ar] 3d⁴ 4s²"
  - "[Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹"
  - "[Ar] 3d⁶ 4s⁰"
  - "[Ar] 3d³ 4s³"
  correct_answer: "[Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹"
  explanation: "Chromium is one of the two exceptional cases in the 3d series (the other being copper). The expected configuration based on the Aufbau principle would be [Ar] 3d⁴ 4s², but the actual configuration is [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹. This exception occurs because of the extra stability associated with half-filled d-orbitals. A half-filled d⁵ configuration has all five d-orbitals singly occupied with parallel spins, maximizing exchange energy and providing additional stability. The symmetry and exchange energy gained from the half-filled configuration (3d⁵) outweighs the small energy cost of promoting one 4s electron to 3d. The energy difference between 3d and 4s orbitals is very small, making this electron rearrangement favorable. This concept is crucial for understanding: (1) the oxidation states of chromium (common states are +3 and +6), (2) the magnetic properties of Cr and its compounds, and (3) why similar exceptions occur in other elements like molybdenum (Mo: [Kr] 4d⁵ 5s¹). Remember: Half-filled (d⁵, d¹⁰) and fully-filled (d¹⁰) configurations provide extra stability."

  question: "Which of the following ions is NOT considered a transition metal ion?"
  options:
  - "Fe²⁺ (3d⁶)"
  - "Cu²⁺ (3d⁹)"
  - "Zn²⁺ (3d¹⁰)"
  - "Mn²⁺ (3d⁵)"
  correct_answer: "Zn²⁺ (3d¹⁰)"
  explanation: "A transition element is defined as an element that has a partially filled d-orbital in its ground state or in any of its common oxidation states. While all transition elements belong to the d-block, not all d-block elements are transition elements. Let's analyze each ion: (1) Fe²⁺ has configuration [Ar] 3d⁶ with partially filled d-orbitals - it IS a transition metal ion. (2) Cu²⁺ has configuration [Ar] 3d⁹ with partially filled d-orbitals - it IS a transition metal ion. (3) Zn²⁺ has configuration [Ar] 3d¹⁰ with completely filled d-orbitals. Zinc metal is [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s², and Zn²⁺ (the most common oxidation state) is [Ar] 3d¹⁰. Since both the element and its common ion have fully filled d-orbitals, Zn is NOT classified as a transition element - it IS a d-block element but NOT a transition element. (4) Mn²⁺ has configuration [Ar] 3d⁵ with half-filled d-orbitals - it IS a transition metal ion. Similarly, Cd and Hg are d-block elements but not transition elements. This distinction explains why Zn, Cd, and Hg have properties different from typical transition metals: they don't form colored compounds, are diamagnetic, show less catalytic activity, and have only one common oxidation state (+2)."

  question: "Calculate the magnetic moment (in Bohr Magnetons) of Fe²⁺ ion (3d⁶)."
  options:
  - "2.83 BM"
  - "3.87 BM"
  - "4.90 BM"
  - "5.92 BM"
  correct_answer: "4.90 BM"
  explanation: "The magnetic moment (μ) of a transition metal ion is calculated using the spin-only formula: μ = √[n(n+2)] BM, where n is the number of unpaired electrons and BM stands for Bohr Magneton. For Fe²⁺: The electronic configuration is [Ar] 3d⁶ 4s⁰ (note that 4s electrons are lost first during ionization). The 6 electrons in the 3d orbital are arranged according to Hund's rule: first, one electron goes into each of the five d-orbitals with parallel spins, then the sixth electron pairs up in one orbital. Distribution: ↑↓ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ (4 unpaired electrons). Therefore, n = 4. Using the formula: μ = √[4(4+2)] = √[4 × 6] = √24 = 4.90 BM. This calculated value closely matches experimental values, confirming Fe²⁺ is paramagnetic with 4 unpaired electrons. The same principle applies to other ions: Cu²⁺ (d⁹) has 1 unpaired electron (μ = 1.73 BM), Ni²⁺ (d⁸) has 2 unpaired electrons (μ = 2.83 BM), and Zn²⁺ (d¹⁰) has 0 unpaired electrons (μ = 0, diamagnetic). This spin-only formula works well for 3d series but may deviate for 4d and 5d series due to orbital angular momentum contributions."
