  Zn (3d¹⁰ 4s²) and Cd (4d¹⁰ 5s²) are not transition elements because they have fully
  filled d-orbitals in both ground state and common oxidation states (+2). Sc and
  Fe have partially filled d-orbitals.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following are NOT considered transition elements?
  options:
  - Sc and Fe
  - Zn and Cd
  - Ti and V
  - Mn and Co
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Zn and Cd
  explanation: 'Zinc (Zn) and Cadmium (Cd) are NOT considered transition elements
    because they have fully filled d-orbitals in both their ground state and common
    oxidation states. **Zn**: Ground state [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s², common ion Zn²⁺ has 3d¹⁰
    (fully filled). **Cd**: Ground state [Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s², common ion Cd²⁺ has 4d¹⁰
    (fully filled). The definition of transition elements requires partially filled
    d-orbitals in the ground state or in at least one common oxidation state. Since
    Zn²⁺ and Cd²⁺ have d¹⁰ configurations with no partially filled d-orbitals, these
    elements don''t exhibit typical transition metal properties like variable oxidation
    states, colored compounds, or catalytic activity. In contrast: **Sc** ([Ar] 3d¹
    4s²) and **Fe** ([Ar] 3d⁶ 4s²) have partially filled d-orbitals. **Ti, V, Mn,
    Co** all have partially filled d-orbitals. Similarly, Hg (5d¹⁰ 6s²) is also not
    a transition element. However, Cu is considered a transition element because
    Cu²⁺ has d⁹ (partially filled).'

  question: What is the defining characteristic of transition elements?
  options:
  - Fully filled d-orbitals in all oxidation states
  - Partially filled d-orbitals in ground state or common oxidation states
  - Completely empty d-orbitals
  - Only s-electrons in the valence shell
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Partially filled d-orbitals in ground state or common oxidation
    states
  explanation: 'The defining characteristic of transition elements is having partially
    filled d-orbitals (d¹ to d⁹) in the ground state OR in at least one common oxidation
    state. This definition explains: (1) **Why Sc to Cu are transition elements**:
    They have d¹-d⁹ configurations in ground state or ions. Example: Fe has 3d⁶,
    Fe²⁺ has 3d⁶, Fe³⁺ has 3d⁵ (all partially filled). (2) **Why Zn is NOT**: Zn
    has 3d¹⁰ 4s², Zn²⁺ has 3d¹⁰ (both fully filled). (3) **Why Cu IS**: Cu has 3d¹⁰
    4s¹ (fully filled), but Cu²⁺ has 3d⁹ (partially filled). The partially filled
    d-orbitals are responsible for characteristic properties of transition elements:
    **Variable oxidation states**: Multiple d-electrons available for bonding. **Colored
    compounds**: d-d electronic transitions absorb visible light. **Paramagnetic
    nature**: Unpaired d-electrons. **Catalytic activity**: Ability to provide electrons
    from d-orbitals. **Complex formation**: d-orbitals available for coordinate bonding.
    Elements with d⁰ (Sc³⁺) or d¹⁰ (Zn²⁺) don''t show these properties fully.'

  question: Which of the following ions has a d¹⁰ configuration?
  options:
  - Fe²⁺
  - Cu²⁺
  - Zn²⁺
  - Ni²⁺
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Zn²⁺
  explanation: 'Zn²⁺ has a d¹⁰ configuration (fully filled d-orbitals). Let''s verify:
    **Zn (Z=30)**: Ground state [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s². **Zn²⁺**: Loses two 4s electrons,
    giving [Ar] 3d¹⁰ (fully filled, 10 d-electrons). This fully filled d¹⁰ configuration
    makes Zn²⁺ colorless, diamagnetic, and non-catalytic. The other ions: **Fe²⁺**:
    Fe (Z=26) is [Ar] 3d⁶ 4s². Fe²⁺ loses two 4s electrons → 3d⁶ (6 d-electrons,
    4 unpaired). **Cu²⁺**: Cu (Z=29) is [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s¹. Cu²⁺ loses one 4s and one
    3d electron → 3d⁹ (9 d-electrons, 1 unpaired). **Ni²⁺**: Ni (Z=28) is [Ar] 3d⁸
    4s². Ni²⁺ loses two 4s electrons → 3d⁸ (8 d-electrons, 2 unpaired). Other d¹⁰
    ions include: **Cu⁺**: [Ar] 3d¹⁰ (colorless, diamagnetic). **Ag⁺**: [Kr] 4d¹⁰
    (colorless). **Au⁺**: [Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d¹⁰ (colorless). Note: When transition metals
    form ions, electrons are lost first from s-orbital, then from d-orbitals.'
