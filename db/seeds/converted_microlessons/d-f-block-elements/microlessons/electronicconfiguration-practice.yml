  question: What is the electronic configuration of Chromium (Cr, Z=24)?
  options:
  - '[Ar] 3d⁴ 4s²'
  - '[Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹'
  - '[Ar] 3d⁶ 4s⁰'
  - '[Ar] 3d³ 4s³'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '[Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹'
  explanation: 'Chromium has an exceptional electronic configuration [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹
    instead of the expected [Ar] 3d⁴ 4s². This exception occurs due to the extra
    stability of half-filled d-orbitals. Here''s why: (1) **Expected configuration**:
    Following the Aufbau principle, we expect 3d⁴ 4s². (2) **Actual configuration**:
    One electron from 4s promotes to 3d, giving 3d⁵ 4s¹. (3) **Reason for stability**:
    The d⁵ configuration (↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑) is half-filled with one electron in each d-orbital,
    which provides: (a) **Exchange energy**: Maximum exchange interactions between
    parallel spins. (b) **Symmetry**: Spherically symmetric electron distribution.
    (c) **Lower repulsion**: Electrons spread across all five orbitals minimize repulsion.
    (4) The energy gained from half-filled d⁵ stability exceeds the energy cost of
    promoting an electron from 4s to 3d. Similarly, Copper (Cu, Z=29) shows [Ar]
    3d¹⁰ 4s¹ instead of 3d⁹ 4s² due to stability of fully-filled d¹⁰ configuration.'

  question: Which element shows an exceptional electronic configuration due to the
    stability of fully-filled d-orbitals?
  options:
  - Manganese (Mn)
  - Copper (Cu)
  - Iron (Fe)
  - Nickel (Ni)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Copper (Cu)
  explanation: 'Copper (Cu, Z=29) shows an exceptional electronic configuration [Ar]
    3d¹⁰ 4s¹ instead of the expected [Ar] 3d⁹ 4s² due to the extra stability of
    fully-filled d¹⁰ orbitals. The fully-filled d¹⁰ configuration (↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓ ↑↓)
    provides: (1) **Maximum exchange energy**: All possible exchange interactions
    between electrons. (2) **Symmetrical distribution**: Spherically symmetric, minimizing
    electron-electron repulsion. (3) **Enhanced stability**: The energy gain from
    d¹⁰ stability exceeds the cost of promoting one electron from 4s to 3d. Other
    elements: **Mn** has regular configuration 3d⁵ 4s² (already half-filled d⁵ in
    expected configuration). **Fe** has regular 3d⁶ 4s². **Ni** has regular 3d⁸
    4s². The two main exceptions in 3d series are: **Cr (Z=24)**: [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹ (half-filled
    d⁵ stability). **Cu (Z=29)**: [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s¹ (fully-filled d¹⁰ stability). Similar
    exceptions occur in 4d series (Mo, Ag) and 5d series (W, Au, Pt).'

  question: Why do Cr and Cu show exceptional electronic configurations?
  options:
  - To achieve noble gas configuration
  - To maximize the number of electrons in s-orbital
  - To achieve extra stability from half-filled (d⁵) or fully-filled (d¹⁰) d-orbitals
  - To minimize the atomic radius
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: To achieve extra stability from half-filled (d⁵) or fully-filled
    (d¹⁰) d-orbitals
  explanation: 'Chromium and Copper show exceptional configurations to achieve extra
    stability from half-filled (d⁵) and fully-filled (d¹⁰) d-orbitals respectively.
    **Chromium**: [Ar] 3d⁵ 4s¹ achieves half-filled d⁵ stability. **Copper**: [Ar]
    3d¹⁰ 4s¹ achieves fully-filled d¹⁰ stability. The stability arises from: (1)
    **Symmetry**: Half-filled (d⁵) and fully-filled (d¹⁰) configurations have spherical
    symmetry, with electrons evenly distributed, reducing repulsion. (2) **Exchange
    energy**: Maximum exchange interactions occur when electrons have parallel spins.
    In d⁵, all five electrons are parallel (↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑). In d¹⁰, maximum pairing
    gives maximum exchange. (3) **Energy balance**: Though promoting an electron
    from 4s to 3d requires energy (4s is lower than 3d), the exchange energy and
    symmetry gained from d⁵ or d¹⁰ provides net stabilization. This is an exception
    to the normal Aufbau principle and shows that electron configuration is determined
    by overall energy minimization, not just orbital filling order. Similar exceptions:
    Mo [Kr] 4d⁵ 5s¹, Ag [Kr] 4d¹⁰ 5s¹.'
