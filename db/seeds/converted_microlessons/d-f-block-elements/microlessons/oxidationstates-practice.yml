  Most common oxidation state of lanthanoids is +3 (Ln³⁺). This results from loss
  of two 6s electrons and one 4f/5d electron. Some show +2 (Eu, Yb) or +4 (Ce, Tb)
  due to stability of specific f-configurations.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'The most common oxidation state of lanthanoids is:'
  options:
  - '+2'
  - '+3'
  - '+4'
  - '+5'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '+3'
  explanation: 'The most common and stable oxidation state of lanthanoids (rare earth
    elements) is +3, giving Ln³⁺ ions. This results from the loss of two 6s electrons
    and one electron from either 4f or 5d orbital. The +3 state is most stable due
    to: (1) Low effective nuclear charge experienced by 4f electrons (poor shielding),
    (2) Relatively small energy difference in removing three electrons, (3) Resulting
    Ln³⁺ configuration achieves some stability. **Exceptions**: Some lanthanoids show
    +2 or +4 states due to extra stability of specific f-electron configurations:
    **+2 states**: Eu²⁺ (achieves half-filled f⁷ configuration), Yb²⁺ (achieves filled
    f¹⁴ configuration). **+4 states**: Ce⁴⁺ (achieves empty f⁰ = [Xe] configuration),
    Tb⁴⁺ (achieves half-filled f⁷). The predominance of +3 state distinguishes lanthanoids
    from transition metals which show variable oxidation states.'

  question: Which lanthanoid can exhibit +4 oxidation state due to achieving an empty
    f⁰ configuration?
  options:
  - Europium (Eu)
  - Cerium (Ce)
  - Ytterbium (Yb)
  - Samarium (Sm)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Cerium (Ce)
  explanation: 'Cerium (Ce) can exhibit +4 oxidation state (Ce⁴⁺) because it achieves
    an empty f⁰ configuration, which is highly stable. **Cerium electron configuration**:
    Ce (Z=58) has [Xe] 4f¹ 5d¹ 6s² configuration in ground state. **Ce³⁺**: [Xe]
    4f¹ (normal +3 state with one f-electron). **Ce⁴⁺**: [Xe] 4f⁰ = [Xe] (achieves
    noble gas configuration, very stable). The +4 state is strongly oxidizing and
    important in chemistry. Example: Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN), (NH₄)₂[Ce(NO₃)₆],
    is a common oxidizing agent in organic chemistry. CeO₂ (cerium dioxide) is used
    as a catalyst. The other lanthanoids: **Europium (Eu²⁺)**: Shows +2 state (f⁷,
    half-filled stability), not +4. **Ytterbium (Yb²⁺)**: Shows +2 state (f¹⁴, filled
    stability), not +4. **Samarium**: Primarily +3, sometimes +2 (f⁶). **Terbium
    (Tb⁴⁺)** also shows +4 state by achieving f⁷ half-filled configuration, but Ce⁴⁺
    is more common and important.'

  question: Which lanthanoids show +2 oxidation state due to stable f-electron configurations?
  options:
  - La and Lu
  - Ce and Tb
  - Eu and Yb
  - Pr and Nd
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Eu and Yb
  explanation: 'Europium (Eu) and Ytterbium (Yb) show +2 oxidation state because
    Eu²⁺ and Yb²⁺ achieve particularly stable f-electron configurations: **Europium**:
    Eu (Z=63) has [Xe] 4f⁷ 6s² ground state. Eu³⁺ = 4f⁶ (normal). Eu²⁺ = 4f⁷ (half-filled,
    extra stable). The f⁷ configuration has all seven f-orbitals singly occupied
    (↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑), maximizing exchange energy and providing spherical symmetry.
    Eu²⁺ compounds are known, e.g., EuSO₄. **Ytterbium**: Yb (Z=70) has [Xe] 4f¹⁴
    6s² ground state. Yb³⁺ = 4f¹³ (normal). Yb²⁺ = 4f¹⁴ (completely filled, extra
    stable). The f¹⁴ configuration has all f-orbitals doubly occupied, providing maximum
    stability. The other options: **La and Lu**: La³⁺ (f⁰) and Lu³⁺ (f¹⁴) are stable
    in +3 state, not +2. **Ce and Tb**: Show +4 state (Ce⁴⁺ achieves f⁰, Tb⁴⁺ achieves
    f⁷). **Pr and Nd**: Primarily show +3 state. The stability of Eu²⁺ and Yb²⁺
    makes them reducing agents, readily donating electrons to return to +3 state.'
