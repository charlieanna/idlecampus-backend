  Actinoids show oxidation states from +3 to +7 because 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals have
  comparable energies and can all participate in bonding. In lanthanoids, 4f orbitals
  are deeply buried and less available.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.

  question: Why do actinoids show greater range of oxidation states compared to lanthanoids?
  options:
  - Actinoids have smaller atomic size
  - 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals have comparable energies
  - Actinoids have no radioactivity
  - 4f orbitals are more available for bonding
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals have comparable energies
  explanation: 'Actinoids show a much greater range of oxidation states (+3 to +7,
    with +3, +4, +5, +6 being common) compared to lanthanoids (predominantly +3, rarely
    +2 or +4). This is because in actinoids, the 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals all have
    comparable energies and can participate in bonding. The small energy difference
    allows multiple electrons to be removed for bonding. In contrast, lanthanoids
    have 4f orbitals that are deeply buried below the 5d and 6s orbitals - they are
    shielded by outer electrons and less available for bonding. Examples: U shows
    +3, +4, +5, +6; Np shows +3 to +7; Pu shows +3 to +7. The common +3 state results
    from loss of two 7s and one 5f (or 6d) electron. Higher oxidation states involve
    additional 5f electrons. Many actinoids are also radioactive, which affects their
    chemistry through radiation effects.'

  question: Which property distinguishes actinoids from lanthanoids?
  options:
  - Actinoids show only +3 oxidation state
  - Actinoid 5f orbitals participate more readily in bonding than lanthanoid 4f orbitals
  - Lanthanoids are all radioactive while actinoids are stable
  - Actinoids have larger atomic radii than lanthanoids
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Actinoid 5f orbitals participate more readily in bonding than lanthanoid
    4f orbitals
  explanation: 'The key distinction is that actinoid 5f orbitals participate more
    readily in bonding compared to lanthanoid 4f orbitals. This occurs because: (1)
    **5f orbitals are larger and more diffuse**: They extend further from the nucleus
    than 4f orbitals, making them more accessible for bonding with ligands. (2) **Comparable
    orbital energies**: In actinoids, 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals have similar energies,
    allowing all to participate in bonding. (3) **Less shielding**: 5f electrons
    are less effectively shielded compared to 4f electrons. Consequences: **Variable
    oxidation states**: Actinoids show +3 to +7, lanthanoids mainly +3. **Complex
    formation**: Actinoids form more covalent complexes; lanthanoids form more ionic
    complexes. **Magnetic properties**: Actinoid compounds show more complex magnetic
    behavior. **Contraction**: Actinoid contraction is more irregular than lanthanoid
    contraction. Note: Most actinoids (all beyond Ac) are radioactive, while lanthanoids
    except Pm are non-radioactive. Actinoids are generally smaller than corresponding
    lanthanoids due to poor shielding by 5f electrons.'

  question: Which of the following statements about actinoids is correct?
  options:
  - All actinoids occur naturally in abundance
  - Actinoids predominantly show +3 oxidation state like lanthanoids
  - Actinoids can show oxidation states up to +7 due to 5f electron participation
  - Actinoid 5f orbitals are more shielded than lanthanoid 4f orbitals
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Actinoids can show oxidation states up to +7 due to 5f electron
    participation
  explanation: 'Actinoids can show oxidation states up to +7 due to participation
    of 5f electrons in bonding, along with 6d and 7s electrons. Examples: **Neptunium
    (Np)**: Shows +3, +4, +5, +6, +7 oxidation states. The +7 state appears in compounds
    like NpO₄³⁻. **Plutonium (Pu)**: Shows +3, +4, +5, +6, +7. Can exist in multiple
    oxidation states simultaneously in solution. **Uranium (U)**: Common states are
    +3, +4, +5, +6. U⁶⁺ forms uranyl ion UO₂²⁺. The other statements are incorrect:
    **Occurrence**: Only Th, Pa, and U occur naturally; others are synthetic. **Oxidation
    states**: Unlike lanthanoids (+3 predominantly), actinoids show wide range. **Shielding**:
    5f orbitals are LESS shielded (more exposed) than 4f orbitals, making them more
    available for bonding. This greater availability of 5f electrons, combined with
    comparable energies of 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals, enables the remarkable variability
    in actinoid oxidation states and their rich chemistry.'
