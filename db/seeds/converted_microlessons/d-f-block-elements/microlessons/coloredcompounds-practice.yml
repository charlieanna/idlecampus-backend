  Zn²⁺ is colorless because it has d¹⁰ configuration (fully filled d-orbitals). No
  d-d transitions are possible. Cu²⁺ (blue), Fe²⁺ (green), and Ni²⁺ (green) are colored
  due to d-d transitions.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following ions is colorless in aqueous solution?
  options:
  - Cu²⁺
  - Fe²⁺
  - Zn²⁺
  - Ni²⁺
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Zn²⁺
  explanation: 'Zn²⁺ is colorless in aqueous solution because it has a d¹⁰ electronic
    configuration (all d-orbitals are fully filled). With no unpaired electrons and
    no possibility of d-d transitions (electrons moving between d-orbitals), it cannot
    absorb visible light, making it colorless. In contrast: **Cu²⁺ (blue)** has d⁹
    configuration with one unpaired electron, allowing d-d transitions that absorb
    red/orange light and transmit blue. **Fe²⁺ (pale green)** has d⁶ configuration
    with unpaired electrons enabling d-d transitions. **Ni²⁺ (green)** has d⁸ configuration
    with unpaired electrons. The general rule: Transition metal ions are colored
    when they have partially filled d-orbitals (d¹-d⁹), allowing electrons to be
    promoted between split d-orbitals in the presence of ligands. Ions with d⁰ (Sc³⁺,
    Ti⁴⁺) or d¹⁰ (Zn²⁺, Cu⁺) configurations are colorless.'

  question: Why are transition metal compounds generally colored?
  options:
  - Due to s-s electronic transitions
  - Due to p-p electronic transitions
  - Due to d-d electronic transitions in partially filled d-orbitals
  - Due to complete absence of electrons in d-orbitals
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Due to d-d electronic transitions in partially filled d-orbitals
  explanation: 'Transition metal compounds are colored due to d-d electronic transitions
    in partially filled d-orbitals. Here''s the mechanism: (1) **Crystal field splitting**:
    When ligands approach the metal ion, they create an electric field that splits
    the five degenerate d-orbitals into two sets of different energies (e.g., t₂g
    and eᵍ in octahedral complexes). (2) **Light absorption**: When visible light
    passes through the compound, electrons in the lower energy d-orbitals absorb
    photons and get excited to higher energy d-orbitals. The energy gap (Δ) corresponds
    to visible light wavelengths. (3) **Complementary color**: The color we observe
    is the complementary color of the absorbed light. For example, if a compound
    absorbs red light, it appears green. Examples: [Ti(H₂O)₆]³⁺ is purple (d¹, absorbs
    green-yellow), [Cu(H₂O)₆]²⁺ is blue (d⁹, absorbs red-orange), [Fe(H₂O)₆]²⁺
    is pale green (d⁶). This requires partially filled d-orbitals (d¹-d⁹).'

  question: Which of the following ions would you expect to be colorless?
  options:
  - Ti³⁺ (d¹)
  - V³⁺ (d²)
  - Sc³⁺ (d⁰)
  - Cr³⁺ (d³)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Sc³⁺ (d⁰)
  explanation: 'Sc³⁺ with d⁰ configuration is colorless because it has no electrons
    in d-orbitals, making d-d transitions impossible. Without d-d transitions, the
    ion cannot absorb visible light and appears colorless. The other ions are colored:
    **Ti³⁺ (d¹)** is purple/violet because the single d-electron can be excited to
    higher d-orbitals in the crystal field, absorbing yellow-green light. **V³⁺
    (d²)** is green due to d-d transitions with two d-electrons. **Cr³⁺ (d³)** is
    green/violet depending on ligands, with three d-electrons allowing multiple d-d
    transitions. General rule for colorless ions: **d⁰ configuration**: Sc³⁺, Ti⁴⁺,
    V⁵⁺ (no d-electrons for transitions). **d¹⁰ configuration**: Zn²⁺, Cu⁺, Ag⁺
    (all d-orbitals filled, no vacant orbitals for promotion). Note: Even though
    Ti⁴⁺ compounds can appear colored due to charge-transfer transitions (different
    from d-d transitions), pure d-d transitions require d¹-d⁹ configurations.'
