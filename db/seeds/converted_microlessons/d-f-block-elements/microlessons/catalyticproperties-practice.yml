  Transition metals are good catalysts due to: (1) Variable oxidation states - can
  accept/donate electrons, (2) Large surface area for adsorption, (3) Ability to form
  intermediates. They are NOT inert - they participate in reaction.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which properties make transition metals good catalysts?
  options:
  - Variable oxidation states, surface adsorption, and formation of intermediates
  - Complete inertness to all reactants
  - Very high ionization energy preventing electron transfer
  - Inability to form any intermediate compounds
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Variable oxidation states, surface adsorption, and formation of
    intermediates
  explanation: 'Transition metals are excellent catalysts due to three key properties
    working together: (1) **Variable oxidation states**: Can easily change oxidation
    states (e.g., Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺, Cu⁺/Cu²⁺, V²⁺/V³⁺/V⁴⁺/V⁺⁵), allowing them to accept and
    donate electrons during reactions, facilitating redox processes. (2) **Large surface
    area for adsorption**: Finely divided transition metals provide large surface
    area where reactant molecules can adsorb, bringing them close together and weakening
    their bonds (e.g., H₂ adsorption on Ni surface in hydrogenation). (3) **Formation
    of intermediate compounds**: Can form temporary bonds with reactants, creating
    reaction intermediates that lower activation energy (e.g., enzyme-substrate complexes
    with Fe in cytochromes). Examples: Fe in Haber process (N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃), V₂O₅
    in Contact process (SO₂ → SO₃), Ni in hydrogenation, Pt in catalytic converters.
    Note: Complete inertness would prevent catalysis - catalysts must interact with
    reactants.'

  question: Which transition metal catalyst is used in the Haber process for ammonia
    synthesis?
  options:
  - Platinum (Pt)
  - Iron (Fe)
  - Nickel (Ni)
  - Vanadium pentoxide (V₂O₅)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Iron (Fe)
  explanation: 'Iron (Fe) is the catalyst used in the Haber process for industrial
    synthesis of ammonia: N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃ (at 450-500°C, 200-300 atm pressure). **How
    Fe catalyst works**: (1) **Adsorption**: N₂ and H₂ molecules adsorb on the iron
    surface. The strong N≡N triple bond is weakened by interaction with iron d-orbitals.
    (2) **Dissociation**: N₂ molecules dissociate into N atoms on the surface. (3)
    **Hydrogenation**: N atoms react with H atoms to form NH, NH₂, then NH₃. (4)
    **Desorption**: NH₃ molecules leave the surface. (5) **Oxidation state changes**:
    Fe can cycle between different oxidation states, facilitating electron transfer.
    The catalyst is actually a mixture of Fe with small amounts of K₂O, CaO, SiO₂,
    and Al₂O₃ as promoters. Other catalysts mentioned: **Pt**: Used in catalytic
    converters and oxidation reactions. **Ni**: Used in hydrogenation of alkenes
    and vegetable oils. **V₂O₅**: Used in Contact process for SO₃ synthesis (2SO₂
    + O₂ → 2SO₃). The Haber process is crucial for fertilizer production.'

  question: Why does finely divided nickel act as a better catalyst than a nickel
    block?
  options:
  - Finely divided nickel has lower density
  - Finely divided nickel provides larger surface area for reactant adsorption
  - Finely divided nickel has different electronic configuration
  - Finely divided nickel is more resistant to corrosion
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Finely divided nickel provides larger surface area for reactant
    adsorption
  explanation: 'Finely divided nickel (like Raney nickel or nickel powder) acts as
    a better catalyst than a nickel block because it provides much larger surface
    area for reactant adsorption. **Surface area effect**: (1) **Large surface area**:
    Breaking nickel into fine particles dramatically increases the total surface area
    exposed to reactants. For example, 1 cm³ nickel block might have ~6 cm² surface
    area, but the same volume as powder could have surface area of hundreds of m².
    (2) **More active sites**: Greater surface area means more catalytic sites where
    reactant molecules can adsorb and react. (3) **Better contact**: Reactant molecules
    can more easily access and interact with the catalyst surface. **Applications**:
    **Raney nickel** (fine nickel powder, highly porous): Used in hydrogenation of
    alkenes (C=C → C-C) and alkynes, reduction of nitriles to amines, hydrogenation
    of vegetable oils (making margarine). **Mechanism**: H₂ molecules adsorb and
    dissociate on Ni surface (H₂ → 2H•). Alkene molecules adsorb nearby. H atoms
    add to C=C bond. Saturated product desorbs. The electronic configuration and
    chemical properties remain the same - only physical form changes to increase
    surface area.'
