  Only three actinoids occur naturally: Thorium (Th), Protactinium (Pa), and Uranium
  (U). All other actinoids are synthetic. Elements beyond U (Z>92) are transuranium
  elements.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: How many actinoids occur naturally in significant amounts?
  options:
  - '1'
  - '2'
  - '3'
  - '4'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '3'
  explanation: 'Only three actinoids occur naturally in significant amounts: Thorium
    (Th, Z=90), Protactinium (Pa, Z=91), and Uranium (U, Z=92). All actinoids beyond
    uranium (Z>92) are transuranium elements that are synthetic and produced in nuclear
    reactors or particle accelerators. These include Neptunium (Np), Plutonium (Pu),
    Americium (Am), and others. While trace amounts of Np and Pu have been detected
    in uranium ores due to neutron capture, they are not considered naturally occurring
    in significant amounts. The naturally occurring actinoids: **Thorium** is most
    abundant, found in monazite sand. **Protactinium** is very rare. **Uranium**
    is found in pitchblende (U₃O₈) and other ores. All three are radioactive with
    very long half-lives, which is why they still exist naturally on Earth.'

  question: Which elements are classified as transuranium elements?
  options:
  - Elements with atomic number less than 92
  - Elements with atomic number equal to 92
  - Elements with atomic number greater than 92
  - Elements with atomic number between 89 and 92
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Elements with atomic number greater than 92
  explanation: 'Transuranium elements are all elements with atomic number greater
    than 92 (beyond uranium). The name literally means "beyond uranium." Since uranium
    (Z=92) is the last naturally occurring actinoid in significant amounts, all elements
    with Z>92 are synthetic and must be produced artificially. Examples include:
    Neptunium (Np, Z=93), Plutonium (Pu, Z=94), Americium (Am, Z=95), Curium (Cm,
    Z=96), Berkelium (Bk, Z=97), Californium (Cf, Z=98), and heavier elements up
    to Lawrencium (Lr, Z=103) in the actinoid series. These elements are produced
    in nuclear reactors through neutron bombardment or in particle accelerators through
    nuclear reactions. They are all radioactive with relatively short half-lives
    compared to naturally occurring actinoids. The first transuranium element, Neptunium,
    was synthesized in 1940 by McMillan and Abelson.'

  question: Which of the following is the most abundant naturally occurring actinoid?
  options:
  - Uranium
  - Thorium
  - Protactinium
  - Plutonium
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Thorium
  explanation: 'Thorium (Th, Z=90) is the most abundant naturally occurring actinoid,
    with an estimated crustal abundance of about 8-12 ppm (parts per million), making
    it more abundant than uranium (~2-4 ppm) and much more abundant than protactinium
    (extremely rare, ~10⁻¹² g/g of Earth''s crust). Thorium is found primarily in
    monazite sand [(Ce,La,Th)PO₄], a phosphate mineral that also contains rare earth
    elements. Other thorium-containing minerals include thorite (ThSiO₄) and thorianite
    (ThO₂). The most common isotope is ²³²Th with a half-life of 14 billion years,
    longer than the age of Earth, which explains its continued presence. Thorium
    is not fissile but is fertile - it can be converted to fissile ²³³U through neutron
    capture, making it potentially useful for nuclear energy. Plutonium is not naturally
    occurring in significant amounts and is a transuranium element (Z=94).'
