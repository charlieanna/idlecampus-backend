  Lanthanoid contraction causes: (1) Similar properties of lanthanoids, (2) Similar
  sizes of 4d and 5d elements (Zr≈Hf), (3) Decreased basicity (not increase), (4)
  Increased complex formation.

  question: Which are consequences of lanthanoid contraction?
  options:
  - Similar properties of lanthanoids and similar sizes of 4d and 5d elements
  - Increase in basicity across the series
  - Decrease in ionization energy
  - Expansion of atomic radii across the series
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Similar properties of lanthanoids and similar sizes of 4d and 5d
    elements
  explanation: 'Lanthanoid contraction leads to several important consequences: (1)
    **Similar properties of lanthanoids**: The gradual decrease in size makes separation
    of individual lanthanoids difficult, as they show very similar chemical properties.
    (2) **Similar sizes of 4d and 5d elements**: Elements in the same group like
    Zr (4d) and Hf (5d), or Nb and Ta, have nearly identical atomic radii. This is
    because the expected increase in size from 4d to 5d is offset by the lanthanoid
    contraction. (3) **Decreased basicity**: As size decreases across the series,
    covalent character increases and ionic character decreases, reducing basicity.
    (4) **Increased complex formation**: Smaller ions have higher charge density,
    leading to greater tendency to form complexes. The lanthanoid contraction is
    caused by poor shielding of 4f electrons - as 4f orbitals fill, they don''t effectively
    shield outer electrons from increasing nuclear charge, causing progressive shrinkage
    of atomic/ionic radii from La to Lu.'

  question: Why does lanthanoid contraction occur?
  options:
  - Poor shielding by 4f electrons leading to increased effective nuclear charge
  - Excellent shielding by 4f electrons
  - Decrease in nuclear charge across the series
  - Increase in the number of electron shells
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Poor shielding by 4f electrons leading to increased effective nuclear
    charge
  explanation: 'Lanthanoid contraction occurs due to poor shielding by 4f electrons,
    which leads to increased effective nuclear charge (Z_eff) experienced by outer
    electrons. Here''s the mechanism: (1) **Poor shielding**: As we move from La
    (4f⁰) to Lu (4f¹⁴), electrons are added to the 4f orbitals. These 4f orbitals
    have a diffuse shape and are buried deep within the atom, making them very ineffective
    at shielding outer 5s, 5p, and 6s electrons from the nuclear charge. (2) **Increasing
    nuclear charge**: Each successive element has one more proton in the nucleus.
    (3) **Net effect**: The increasing nuclear charge is not adequately compensated
    by the shielding from 4f electrons, so Z_eff increases progressively. (4) **Contraction**:
    Higher Z_eff pulls outer electrons closer, shrinking atomic and ionic radii. The
    contraction is steady: La³⁺ radius = 106 pm, while Lu³⁺ radius = 85 pm, a decrease
    of ~21 pm across 14 elements. This is much more significant than typical size
    variations in transition series.'

  question: Which pair of elements has almost identical atomic radii due to lanthanoid
    contraction?
  options:
  - Na and K
  - Zr and Hf
  - Li and Na
  - C and Si
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Zr and Hf
  explanation: 'Zirconium (Zr, 4d series) and Hafnium (Hf, 5d series) have almost
    identical atomic radii (both ~155 pm) due to the lanthanoid contraction. This
    is remarkable because normally we expect atomic radius to increase down a group.
    Here''s why Zr and Hf are similar: **Normal expectation**: Hf should be larger
    than Zr because it has an additional electron shell (6s² 5d² vs 5s² 4d²). **Lanthanoid
    contraction effect**: Between Zr (Z=40) and Hf (Z=72), the entire lanthanoid
    series (La to Lu) is inserted. The poor shielding by 4f electrons causes significant
    contraction in the 5d series. **Result**: The expected size increase from 4d
    to 5d is exactly cancelled by the lanthanoid contraction, making Zr and Hf almost
    identical in size. **Consequences**: Zr and Hf are extremely difficult to separate
    chemically and show very similar properties. Similarly, Nb/Ta and Mo/W pairs
    also show this effect. This makes hafnium one of the last naturally occurring
    elements to be discovered (1923), as it was hidden with zirconium.'
