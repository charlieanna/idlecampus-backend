  CO₂ contributes about 60% to global warming, followed by CH₄ (20%), CFCs (14%),
  and N₂O (6%). CO₂ from fossil fuel combustion is the primary greenhouse gas.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which gas is the major contributor to global warming?
  options:
  - CH₄ (Methane)
  - CO₂ (Carbon dioxide)
  - N₂O (Nitrous oxide)
  - CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: CO₂ (Carbon dioxide)
  explanation: '**Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** contributes about **60%** to global warming,
    making it the major greenhouse gas. **Contribution to global warming**: CO₂ ~60%,
    CH₄ (methane) ~20%, CFCs ~14%, N₂O (nitrous oxide) ~6%. **Why CO₂ is dominant**:
    (1) **Large emissions**: Massive release from fossil fuel combustion (coal, oil,
    natural gas) in power plants, vehicles, industries, (2) **Deforestation**: Reduces
    CO₂ absorption by plants, (3) **Long atmospheric lifetime**: 50-200 years (persists
    much longer than CH₄ which lasts ~12 years). **Sources of CO₂**: Burning of fossil
    fuels (75%), Deforestation and land-use changes (25%). Although CH₄ is 25 times
    more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO₂ (per molecule), CO₂''s sheer volume
    and persistence make it the primary driver of climate change. Controlling CO₂
    emissions through renewable energy, energy efficiency, and reforestation is critical
    for mitigating global warming.'

  question: Which greenhouse gas has the highest Global Warming Potential (GWP) per
    molecule?
  options:
  - CO₂
  - CH₄
  - N₂O
  - CFCs
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: CFCs
  explanation: '**CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons)** have the highest Global Warming Potential
    (GWP) per molecule among common greenhouse gases. **GWP comparison** (relative
    to CO₂ = 1, over 100 years): CO₂ = 1 (baseline), CH₄ = 25 (methane is 25× more
    potent), N₂O = 298 (nitrous oxide is 298× more potent), CFCs = 4,750-14,400 (depending
    on type; CFC-12 = ~10,900). **Why CFCs are so potent**: Strong C-F bonds absorb
    infrared radiation very efficiently, extremely long atmospheric lifetime (50-100+
    years), no natural sinks for degradation. **Additional problem**: CFCs also destroy
    stratospheric ozone (Montreal Protocol banned them in 1987). Despite high GWP,
    CFCs contribute only ~14% to total global warming because their atmospheric concentrations
    are much lower than CO₂. **Current status**: CFCs being replaced by HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons)
    which don''t harm ozone but still have high GWP, leading to the Kigali Amendment
    (2016) to phase down HFCs.'

  question: What is the primary source of methane (CH₄) emissions?
  options:
  - Fossil fuel combustion
  - Rice paddies and livestock
  - Vehicle exhaust
  - Industrial processes
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Rice paddies and livestock
  explanation: '**Rice paddies and livestock** are the primary sources of atmospheric
    methane (CH₄), contributing about 50-60% of total anthropogenic CH₄ emissions.
    **Major sources of methane**: (1) **Agriculture** (40%): Enteric fermentation
    in ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats produce CH₄ during digestion), rice cultivation
    in flooded paddies (anaerobic bacteria produce CH₄ in waterlogged soil), animal
    manure. (2) **Fossil fuels** (30%): Natural gas leaks from pipelines, coal mining
    (CH₄ trapped in coal seams), petroleum extraction. (3) **Waste** (20%): Landfills
    (anaerobic decomposition of organic waste), wastewater treatment. (4) **Natural
    sources** (10%): Wetlands (largest natural source), termites, oceans. **Why concern
    about CH₄**: 25× more potent than CO₂ as greenhouse gas, increasing concentrations
    due to expanding agriculture and fossil fuel use, shorter lifetime (~12 years)
    means reducing emissions has faster climate impact. **Mitigation**: Improved
    livestock feed, better rice cultivation practices, capturing landfill gas for
    energy, reducing natural gas leaks.'
