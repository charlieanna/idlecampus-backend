  Chlorine radicals from CFCs catalytically destroy ozone: Cl· + O₃ → ClO· + O₂, ClO·
  + O → Cl· + O₂. One Cl· can destroy 100,000 O₃ molecules. This is the mechanism
  of ozone layer depletion.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following catalytically destroys ozone in the stratosphere?
  options:
  - Oxygen radicals (O·)
  - Chlorine radicals (Cl·)
  - Nitrogen molecules (N₂)
  - Carbon dioxide (CO₂)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Chlorine radicals (Cl·)
  explanation: '**Chlorine radicals (Cl·)** from CFCs catalytically destroy stratospheric
    ozone through a chain reaction. **Mechanism**: (1) CFCs (e.g., CF₂Cl₂) are stable
    in troposphere but break down in stratosphere under UV radiation: CF₂Cl₂ + UV
    → CF₂Cl· + Cl·. (2) Chlorine radical destroys ozone: Cl· + O₃ → ClO· + O₂. (3)
    ClO· regenerates Cl· radical: ClO· + O → Cl· + O₂. (4) Net reaction: O₃ + O
    → 2O₂ (Cl· acts as catalyst). **Catalytic nature**: One Cl· atom can destroy
    **~100,000 O₃ molecules** before being removed by reaction with CH₄ or NO₂. Other
    ozone-depleting species: Br· (from halons, even more destructive), NO· (from
    N₂O, natural and anthropogenic). **Consequences**: Ozone hole over Antarctica
    (discovered 1985), increased UV-B radiation reaching Earth, higher skin cancer
    and cataract rates, damage to phytoplankton and crops. **Montreal Protocol (1987)**
    successfully phased out CFCs, allowing ozone layer recovery (expected by 2060-2070).'

  question: What is the primary role of stratospheric ozone (O₃)?
  options:
  - Produces oxygen for breathing
  - Absorbs harmful UV-B and UV-C radiation
  - Causes acid rain
  - Contributes to global warming
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Absorbs harmful UV-B and UV-C radiation
  explanation: 'The primary role of stratospheric ozone is to **absorb harmful UV-B
    (280-320 nm) and UV-C (< 280 nm) radiation** from the sun, protecting life on
    Earth. **Ozone formation** (Chapman cycle): O₂ + UV → 2O· (oxygen dissociation),
    O· + O₂ + M → O₃ + M (ozone formation, M = N₂ or O₂). **UV absorption**: O₃
    + UV → O₂ + O· (ozone absorbs UV and dissociates). **Why this matters**: UV-C
    radiation is completely absorbed by O₂ and O₃ in upper atmosphere, UV-B is partially
    absorbed by O₃ (ozone depletion increases UV-B reaching Earth), UV-A (320-400
    nm) is not absorbed and reaches surface (mostly harmless). **Effects of UV-B**:
    Damages DNA causing mutations, skin cancer (melanoma, basal cell carcinoma),
    cataracts and eye damage, suppresses immune system, damages phytoplankton (base
    of marine food chain), reduces crop yields. Note: Stratospheric O₃ (15-35 km
    altitude) is "good ozone", while tropospheric O₃ (ground-level) is "bad ozone"
    (pollutant causing respiratory problems).'

  question: Which international treaty successfully addressed ozone depletion?
  options:
  - Kyoto Protocol (1997)
  - Paris Agreement (2015)
  - Montreal Protocol (1987)
  - Rio Declaration (1992)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Montreal Protocol (1987)
  explanation: 'The **Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer
    (1987)** is the most successful international environmental treaty, effectively
    addressing ozone depletion. **Key features**: Phased out production and consumption
    of ozone-depleting substances (ODS): CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄),
    methyl chloroform (CH₃CCl₃), HCFCs (being phased out by 2030). Different phase-out
    schedules for developed vs. developing countries. Multilateral Fund to help developing
    nations transition. Regular amendments (London, Copenhagen, Montreal, Beijing,
    Kigali). **Success indicators**: 99% reduction in ODS production since 1987,
    atmospheric concentrations of major CFCs declining, Antarctic ozone hole stabilized
    and slowly recovering, stratospheric ozone expected to return to 1980 levels
    by 2060-2070. **Why successful?**: Scientific consensus on ozone depletion, availability
    of CFC alternatives, industry cooperation, strong compliance mechanisms. **Kigali
    Amendment (2016)** extends protocol to phase down HFCs (CFC replacements that
    don''t harm ozone but contribute to global warming). In contrast, Kyoto Protocol
    and Paris Agreement address climate change, not ozone depletion.'
