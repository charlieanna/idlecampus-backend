  \       - Dead algae decompose\n       - Decomposition consumes oxygen (high BOD)\n\
  \       - Dissolved oxygen drops\n    5. **Fish death**: Aquatic animals die due\

    question: "What is the correct relationship between BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) for the same water sample?"
    options:
      - "BOD is always greater than COD"
      - "COD is always greater than or equal to BOD"
      - "BOD and COD are always equal"
      - "There is no consistent relationship between BOD and COD"
    correct_answer: "COD is always greater than or equal to BOD"
    explanation: "COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) is always greater than or equal to BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) for the same water sample. This relationship exists because of the fundamental difference in what each parameter measures. BOD measures only the biodegradable organic matter that can be decomposed by microorganisms under aerobic conditions over a 5-day period at 20°C. It represents the amount of oxygen consumed by bacteria and other microbes during biological oxidation. In contrast, COD measures the total oxygen required to chemically oxidize all organic and inorganic matter in water using a strong oxidizing agent like potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇) in acidic medium. The chemical oxidation is complete within a few hours and oxidizes both biodegradable and non-biodegradable (recalcitrant) organic compounds, as well as some inorganic reducing substances. Since COD includes everything that BOD measures plus additional non-biodegradable matter, COD ≥ BOD. The ratio COD/BOD provides information about biodegradability: a ratio close to 1 indicates most organic matter is biodegradable, while a high ratio suggests significant non-biodegradable pollution. For clean water, both values are low (BOD < 5 ppm)."

    question: "What is the PRIMARY mechanism by which eutrophication leads to the death of fish in water bodies?"
    options:
      - "Algae produce toxins that directly poison the fish"
      - "Excessive algal growth blocks sunlight, killing underwater plants; decomposition of dead algae and plants depletes dissolved oxygen"
      - "The nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) are directly toxic to fish"
      - "The water temperature increases due to algal blooms"
    correct_answer: "Excessive algal growth blocks sunlight, killing underwater plants; decomposition of dead algae and plants depletes dissolved oxygen"
    explanation: "Eutrophication is a multi-step process that ultimately kills fish through oxygen depletion, not through direct toxicity. The process begins when excessive nutrients (particularly nitrates from fertilizers and phosphates from detergents) enter water bodies. These nutrients stimulate explosive growth of algae and cyanobacteria, creating dense algal blooms on the water surface. This dense surface layer blocks sunlight from penetrating to underwater plants (submerged macrophytes). Without adequate light for photosynthesis, these underwater plants die. The accumulation of dead algae and plants provides abundant organic matter for decomposer bacteria. These aerobic bacteria consume large amounts of dissolved oxygen (increasing BOD) as they decompose the dead biomass. As dissolved oxygen levels drop, a hypoxic (low oxygen) or anoxic (no oxygen) condition develops. Fish and other aquatic animals cannot survive in these oxygen-depleted conditions and die from suffocation. In severe cases, anaerobic decomposition begins, producing foul-smelling gases like H₂S (hydrogen sulfide) and CH₄ (methane). The nutrients themselves are not directly toxic; they trigger this cascade of ecological disruption. Prevention requires reducing nutrient input through better agricultural practices and using phosphate-free detergents."

    question: "Minamata disease, which caused severe neurological damage in Japan in the 1950s, was caused by which heavy metal and through what mechanism?"
    options:
      - "Lead (Pb) from industrial batteries leaching into drinking water"
      - "Mercury (Hg) from industrial waste bioaccumulating in fish through the food chain"
      - "Cadmium (Cd) from mining operations contaminating rice paddies"
      - "Arsenic (As) from pesticides accumulating in groundwater"
    correct_answer: "Mercury (Hg) from industrial waste bioaccumulating in fish through the food chain"
    explanation: "Minamata disease is one of the most tragic examples of industrial pollution and biomagnification. In the 1950s, a chemical plant in Minamata Bay, Japan, discharged industrial wastewater containing methylmercury (CH₃Hg⁺) into the bay. The mercury accumulated in shellfish and fish through a process called biomagnification. Unlike simple bioaccumulation where organisms absorb pollutants directly from the environment, biomagnification specifically refers to the increasing concentration of pollutants as they move up the food chain. Methylmercury binds to proteins in fish muscle and is not easily excreted. Small fish accumulate mercury from contaminated water and sediment. Larger predatory fish eat many small fish, concentrating the mercury further. Humans eating contaminated fish (especially larger predatory species) received very high mercury doses. Methylmercury is highly neurotoxic, crossing the blood-brain barrier and causing severe neurological damage: tremors, numbness, vision and hearing impairment, paralysis, insanity, and death. The disease was particularly devastating for fetuses, causing severe congenital defects. Over 2,000 people were affected, with hundreds dying. This disaster led to strict regulations on mercury discharge and highlighted the dangers of persistent pollutants that biomagnify through food chains. Other examples of biomagnifying pollutants include DDT and PCBs."
