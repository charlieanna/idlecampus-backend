  Photochemical smog (Los Angeles type) forms in warm, sunny conditions and contains
  NO₂, O₃, and PAN. It is oxidizing in nature. Classical smog (London type) contains
  SO₂ and forms in cool, humid conditions.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following are characteristics of photochemical smog?
  options:
  - Contains NO₂, O₃, and PAN; forms in sunny, warm conditions
  - Contains high SO₂ and forms in cool, humid conditions
  - Forms only at night in cold weather
  - Is reducing in nature like classical smog
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Contains NO₂, O₃, and PAN; forms in sunny, warm conditions
  explanation: 'Photochemical smog (Los Angeles-type smog) has these characteristics:
    (1) **Composition**: Contains nitrogen dioxide (NO₂, brown gas), ozone (O₃), and
    peroxyacyl nitrates (PAN, eye irritants), (2) **Formation conditions**: Forms
    in warm, sunny climates where UV light drives photochemical reactions, (3) **Chemistry**:
    NO₂ + sunlight → NO + O; O + O₂ → O₃; hydrocarbons + NO₂ + O₃ → PAN, (4) **Nature**:
    Oxidizing (unlike classical smog which is reducing). In contrast, classical smog
    (London-type) contains SO₂ and particulates, forms in cool, humid conditions from
    coal burning. Photochemical smog causes respiratory problems, damages plants,
    and reduces visibility.'

  question: What is the main difference between photochemical smog and classical smog?
  options:
  - Photochemical smog is oxidizing; classical smog is reducing
  - Photochemical smog forms at night; classical smog forms during day
  - Photochemical smog contains SO₂; classical smog contains O₃
  - Both are identical in composition
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Photochemical smog is oxidizing; classical smog is reducing
  explanation: 'The main difference is their **chemical nature and composition**:
    **Photochemical smog (Los Angeles-type)**: **Oxidizing** in nature, contains
    NO₂, O₃, PAN (strong oxidants), forms in warm, sunny, dry conditions, requires
    UV light for formation, brown haze appearance, primary sources: automobile exhaust
    (NOₓ and unburned hydrocarbons). **Classical smog (London-type)**: **Reducing**
    in nature, contains SO₂ and particulate matter (soot, smoke), forms in cool,
    humid, foggy conditions, occurs in winter from coal/biomass burning, grayish-white
    appearance, can occur day or night (doesn''t require sunlight). **Historical
    examples**: London fog (1952 Great Smog killed 4,000+ people), Los Angeles smog
    (1940s-present, though improved). **Health effects**: Both cause respiratory
    problems, but photochemical smog particularly irritates eyes (PAN), while classical
    smog aggravates bronchitis and emphysema (SO₂). Modern cities typically experience
    photochemical smog due to vehicle emissions, while classical smog is rare in
    developed nations after clean air regulations.'

  question: Which of the following is a key component that causes eye irritation
    in photochemical smog?
  options:
  - SO₂
  - PAN (Peroxyacyl nitrates)
  - CO
  - Particulate matter
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: PAN (Peroxyacyl nitrates)
  explanation: '**PAN (Peroxyacyl nitrates)** is the primary eye irritant in photochemical
    smog. **Formation of PAN**: Hydrocarbons (from vehicle exhaust) + NO₂ + O₃ +
    sunlight → PAN. Example: CH₃CO·OO·NO₂ (peroxyacetyl nitrate). **Effects of PAN**:
    Powerful lachrymator (causes tears and eye irritation), damages plants (chlorosis,
    glazing of leaves), oxidizes proteins and lipids, contributes to respiratory
    problems, secondary pollutant (formed through reactions, not directly emitted).
    **Other photochemical smog components**: **O₃ (Ozone)**: Respiratory irritant,
    damages lungs, harms plants, cracks rubber. **NO₂**: Brown gas, respiratory irritant,
    contributes to acid rain. **Aldehydes** (formaldehyde, acrolein): Tear-producing,
    respiratory irritants. **Control measures**: Reduce NOₓ emissions (catalytic
    converters in vehicles), reduce VOC emissions (vapor recovery at gas stations),
    use cleaner fuels, promote public transport. Note: SO₂ and particulates are components
    of classical smog, not photochemical smog.'
