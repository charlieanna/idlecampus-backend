  \ Greenhouse Effect\n\n    **Definition**: Warming of Earth's surface due to trapping\
  \ of infrared radiation by greenhouse gases.\n\n    **Mechanism**:\n    1. Solar\
  \ radiation (UV, visible) passes through atmosphere\n    2. Earth absorbs and re-emits\
  \ as infrared (heat)\n    3. Greenhouse gases absorb infrared → warm atmosphere\n\
  \    4. Natural greenhouse effect maintains Earth's temperature (~15°C average)\n\
  \n    **Without greenhouse effect**: Earth's temperature would be -18°C (too cold\
  \ for life)\n\n    ### Greenhouse Gases\n\n    | Gas | Sources | Contribution to\
  \ Warming |\n    |-----|---------|------------------------|\n    | **CO₂** | Fossil\
  \ fuel combustion, deforestation | 60% |\n    | **CH₄** | Paddy fields, livestock,\
  \ landfills, natural gas | 20% |\n    | **CFC** | Refrigerants, aerosols | 14% |\n\
  \    | **N₂O** | Fertilizers, combustion | 6% |\n\n    **Note**: CH₄ is 25 times\
  \ more potent than CO₂ as a greenhouse gas.\n\n    ### Global Warming\n\n    **Definition**:\

  \ and storage\n    - International agreements (Paris Agreement)\n\n    ---\n\n \
  \   ## Stratospheric Pollution\n\n    ### Ozone Layer\n\n    **Location**: Stratosphere\
  \ (15-30 km altitude)\n\n    **Formation**:\n    - O₂ + UV → O + O (photodissociation,\
  \ λ < 240 nm)\n    - O + O₂ → O₃ (ozone)\n\n    **Importance**: Absorbs harmful\
  \ UV-B radiation (280-320 nm)\n    - UV-A (320-400 nm): Least harmful, passes through\n\
  \    - UV-B (280-320 nm): Causes skin cancer, cataracts (absorbed by O₃)\n    -\
  \ UV-C (< 280 nm): Most harmful, absorbed by O₂ and O₃\n\n    ### Ozone Depletion\n\
  \n    **Definition**: Reduction in stratospheric ozone concentration, especially\
  \ over Antarctica (\"ozone hole\").\n\n    **Causes**: Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)\
  \ and other halogenated compounds\n\n    #### Chemistry of Ozone Depletion\n\n \
  \   **CFCs** (e.g., CFCl₃, CF₂Cl₂):\n    1. CFCs released at ground level → diffuse\
  \ to stratosphere\n    2. UV radiation breaks C-Cl bond: CF₂Cl₂ + UV → CF₂Cl· +\
  \ Cl·\n    3. Chlorine radical catalyzes O₃ destruction:\n       - Cl· + O₃ → ClO·\
  \ + O₂\n       - ClO· + O → Cl· + O₂\n       - **Net**: O₃ + O → 2O₂ (Cl· regenerated\
  \ → catalytic cycle)\n    4. One Cl· atom can destroy 100,000 O₃ molecules\n\n \
  \   **Other ozone-depleting substances**:\n    - Halons (used in fire extinguishers)\n\
  \    - CCl₄ (carbon tetrachloride)\n    - CH₃CCl₃ (methyl chloroform)\n    - N₂O\

  \ marine food chain)\n    - Crop damage\n\n    **Montreal Protocol (1987)**:\n \
  \   - International treaty to phase out CFCs\n    - Replacement: HFCs (hydrogen-containing,\
  \ less harmful)\n    - Success story: Ozone hole is slowly recovering\n\n    ---\n\

    question: "What is the PRIMARY difference between classical smog (London-type) and photochemical smog (Los Angeles-type)?"
    options:
      - "Classical smog occurs in summer; photochemical smog occurs in winter"
      - "Classical smog is reducing in nature containing SO₂ and particulates in cool, humid conditions; photochemical smog is oxidizing containing O₃ and NO₂ in warm, sunny conditions"
      - "Classical smog is caused by automobiles; photochemical smog is caused by industrial emissions"
      - "Classical smog is more harmful than photochemical smog"
    correct_answer: "Classical smog is reducing in nature containing SO₂ and particulates in cool, humid conditions; photochemical smog is oxidizing containing O₃ and NO₂ in warm, sunny conditions"
    explanation: "Classical smog and photochemical smog are fundamentally different in composition, formation conditions, and chemical nature. Classical smog (London-type) is also called 'reducing smog' because it contains reducing substances like sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and particulate matter. It forms in cool, humid climates when smoke from coal combustion combines with fog, hence 'smog' (smoke + fog). The chemistry involves: SO₂ + H₂O → H₂SO₃ (in fog droplets), creating a corrosive, acidic mist. This type of smog was responsible for the infamous 1952 London disaster that killed thousands. In contrast, photochemical smog (Los Angeles-type) is 'oxidizing smog' containing strong oxidants like ozone (O₃), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN). It requires warm, dry, sunny conditions to form. The chemistry begins with NO₂ photodissociation: NO₂ + sunlight → NO + O·, followed by O· + O₂ → O₃. Hydrocarbons from automobile exhaust react with oxygen radicals to form aldehydes and PAN. This creates a characteristic brown haze, peaks at noon (maximum sunlight), and causes eye irritation. While classical smog is controlled by reducing SO₂ emissions, photochemical smog requires catalytic converters and cleaner fuels to reduce NOₓ and hydrocarbon emissions."

    question: "How does a single chlorine radical (Cl·) from CFCs cause such extensive ozone depletion in the stratosphere?"
    options:
      - "Chlorine directly breaks down ozone molecules through a one-time reaction"
      - "Chlorine acts as a catalyst in a regenerative cycle, destroying up to 100,000 ozone molecules before being removed"
      - "Chlorine combines with ozone to form stable compounds that fall to Earth"
      - "Chlorine increases UV radiation which then breaks down ozone"
    correct_answer: "Chlorine acts as a catalyst in a regenerative cycle, destroying up to 100,000 ozone molecules before being removed"
    explanation: "The catastrophic effectiveness of chlorine radicals in destroying stratospheric ozone arises from their catalytic mechanism. When CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) like CF₂Cl₂ reach the stratosphere, UV radiation breaks the C-Cl bond: CF₂Cl₂ + UV → CF₂Cl· + Cl·. The released chlorine radical then participates in a catalytic cycle that regenerates itself: Step 1: Cl· + O₃ → ClO· + O₂ (chlorine destroys ozone, forming chlorine monoxide radical). Step 2: ClO· + O → Cl· + O₂ (chlorine radical is regenerated). Net reaction: O₃ + O → 2O₂ (ozone destruction, chlorine is not consumed). Because the chlorine radical is regenerated in Step 2, it can repeat this cycle many times. A single Cl· atom can destroy approximately 100,000 ozone molecules before it is finally removed through reactions forming HCl or ClONO₂. This catalytic nature makes CFCs extraordinarily destructive to the ozone layer despite their relatively low atmospheric concentrations. The chlorine remains active for years in the stratosphere. This mechanism was discovered by Molina and Rowland, earning them the Nobel Prize, and led to the Montreal Protocol banning CFCs. The ozone layer protects Earth by absorbing harmful UV-B radiation (280-320 nm); its depletion increases skin cancer, cataracts, immune suppression, and ecosystem damage."

    question: "Why is carbon monoxide (CO) particularly dangerous as an air pollutant despite being colorless and odorless?"
    options:
      - "CO is highly flammable and causes explosions"
      - "CO binds to hemoglobin about 200 times more strongly than oxygen, forming stable carboxyhemoglobin and blocking oxygen transport"
      - "CO reacts with water in lungs to form carbonic acid"
      - "CO is a greenhouse gas that causes global warming"
    correct_answer: "CO binds to hemoglobin about 200 times more strongly than oxygen, forming stable carboxyhemoglobin and blocking oxygen transport"
    explanation: "Carbon monoxide (CO) is one of the most dangerous air pollutants because of its insidious nature and specific mechanism of toxicity. Being colorless, odorless, and tasteless, CO gives no warning of its presence, earning it the name 'silent killer.' The extreme danger of CO arises from its affinity for hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. Hemoglobin normally binds oxygen in the lungs and releases it to tissues: Hb + O₂ ⇌ HbO₂. However, CO binds to the same iron-heme site on hemoglobin about 200-300 times more strongly than oxygen: Hb + CO → COHb (carboxyhemoglobin). This strong binding has two critical consequences: (1) CO displaces oxygen from hemoglobin, reducing oxygen-carrying capacity. (2) The CO-hemoglobin bond is very stable and slow to dissociate, keeping hemoglobin occupied and unavailable for oxygen transport. As COHb levels increase, tissues become oxygen-starved (hypoxia), affecting the brain and heart most severely. Symptoms progress from headache and dizziness (10-20% COHb) to unconsciousness (30-40%) to death (>50%). The primary source is incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, especially from automobile exhausts and poorly ventilated heaters. Treatment involves fresh air or oxygen therapy to gradually displace CO from hemoglobin. Catalytic converters in vehicles oxidize CO to CO₂: 2CO + O₂ → 2CO₂, significantly reducing this hazard."
