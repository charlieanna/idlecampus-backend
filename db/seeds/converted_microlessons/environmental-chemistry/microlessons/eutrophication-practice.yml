  Eutrophication is caused by excessive nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from fertilizers
  and detergents. This leads to algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and death of aquatic
  life.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'Eutrophication of water bodies is primarily caused by excessive:'
  options:
  - Heavy metals
  - Nitrogen and phosphorus
  - CO₂
  - Organic solvents
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Nitrogen and phosphorus
  explanation: 'Eutrophication is the excessive enrichment of water bodies with nutrients,
    primarily nitrogen (from fertilizers, sewage) and phosphorus (from detergents
    containing phosphates, fertilizers). The process: (1) Nutrient runoff enters lakes/rivers,
    (2) Rapid algal growth (algal bloom) occurs, covering the surface, (3) When algae
    die, aerobic bacteria decompose them, consuming dissolved oxygen, (4) Oxygen depletion
    (hypoxia/anoxia) kills fish and aquatic animals, (5) Water becomes foul-smelling
    and unusable. Prevention: use phosphate-free detergents, control agricultural
    runoff, treat sewage before discharge. Eutrophication is a major water pollution
    problem affecting ecosystems worldwide, creating "dead zones" in coastal areas.'

  question: What is the immediate consequence of excessive algal growth in eutrophic
    waters?
  options:
  - Increased fish population
  - Depletion of dissolved oxygen when algae die
  - Improved water clarity
  - Decreased nutrient levels
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Depletion of dissolved oxygen when algae die
  explanation: 'The immediate consequence of excessive algal growth (algal bloom)
    is **depletion of dissolved oxygen** when the algae die and decompose. **Eutrophication
    sequence**: (1) **Nutrient input**: Excess N and P from agricultural runoff (fertilizers),
    sewage discharge, and industrial waste, (2) **Algal bloom**: Rapid proliferation
    of algae and cyanobacteria covering water surface (green scum), blocking sunlight
    to aquatic plants below, (3) **Algal death**: Short lifespan algae die in large
    quantities, (4) **Decomposition**: Aerobic bacteria decompose dead algae, consuming
    massive amounts of dissolved oxygen (DO), (5) **Oxygen depletion**: DO drops
    from normal 8-10 mg/L to < 2 mg/L (hypoxia/anoxia), (6) **Fish kills**: Fish
    and other aquatic animals suffocate due to lack of oxygen, (7) **Dead zones**:
    Areas devoid of aquatic life. **Additional problems**: Some cyanobacteria produce
    toxins harmful to humans and animals, foul odor from anaerobic decomposition
    (H₂S), water becomes unsuitable for drinking or recreation. Famous examples:
    Gulf of Mexico dead zone, Baltic Sea, Lake Erie.'

  question: Which of the following is the most effective method to prevent eutrophication?
  options:
  - Adding more fish to consume algae
  - Reducing nutrient input from agricultural and sewage sources
  - Increasing water temperature
  - Adding pesticides to kill algae
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Reducing nutrient input from agricultural and sewage sources
  explanation: '**Reducing nutrient input** from agricultural runoff and sewage is
    the most effective method to prevent eutrophication. Prevention strategies: (1)
    **Agricultural practices**: Use precision farming to minimize fertilizer application,
    create buffer zones (vegetated strips) between farms and water bodies to absorb
    nutrients, practice crop rotation and cover cropping to reduce nutrient runoff,
    apply fertilizers during dry periods to prevent washoff. (2) **Sewage treatment**:
    Upgrade wastewater treatment plants with tertiary treatment for nutrient removal,
    use biological and chemical phosphorus removal processes, ban or restrict phosphate-containing
    detergents. (3) **Phosphate detergents**: Switch to phosphate-free detergents
    (many countries have banned phosphates in detergents). (4) **Wetland restoration**:
    Construct or restore wetlands to act as natural filters. **Why focus on nutrients?**:
    Addresses root cause rather than symptoms, more cost-effective long-term than
    treating symptoms, sustainable solution. Adding fish or pesticides are temporary
    fixes that don''t address the underlying problem and may cause additional ecological
    damage.'
