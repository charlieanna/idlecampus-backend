  Normal rain has pH ~5.6 because atmospheric CO₂ dissolves to form weak carbonic
  acid: CO₂ + H₂O → H₂CO₃. Acid rain has pH < 5.6 due to SO₂ and NOₓ.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the approximate pH of normal rainwater?
  options:
  - '7.0'
  - '5.6'
  - '4.5'
  - '8.0'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '5.6'
  explanation: 'Normal rainwater has a pH of approximately 5.6 (slightly acidic) because
    atmospheric CO₂ dissolves in water to form weak carbonic acid (H₂CO₃): CO₂ +
    H₂O ⇌ H₂CO₃ ⇌ H⁺ + HCO₃⁻. This natural acidity is NOT considered acid rain. Acid
    rain has pH < 5.6 due to additional acidic pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO₂)
    and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) from industrial emissions and vehicle exhaust. These
    form strong acids: 2SO₂ + O₂ → 2SO₃; SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄ (sulfuric acid), and 4NO₂
    + O₂ + 2H₂O → 4HNO₃ (nitric acid). Acid rain causes environmental damage including
    corrosion of buildings/monuments, acidification of lakes killing aquatic life,
    and damage to vegetation/forests.'

  question: Which of the following gases are primarily responsible for acid rain?
  options:
  - CO₂ and O₂
  - SO₂ and NOₓ
  - CH₄ and CO
  - N₂ and Ar
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: SO₂ and NOₓ
  explanation: 'Acid rain is primarily caused by sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen
    oxides (NOₓ, mainly NO and NO₂). **Sources of SO₂**: Coal and petroleum combustion
    in power plants and industries (fossil fuels contain sulfur impurities), volcanic
    eruptions. **Sources of NOₓ**: Vehicle exhaust (high-temperature combustion of
    N₂ and O₂ in engines: N₂ + O₂ → 2NO), industrial processes, lightning. **Formation
    of acid rain**: SO₂ oxidizes to SO₃ (2SO₂ + O₂ → 2SO₃), which reacts with water
    to form sulfuric acid (SO₃ + H₂O → H₂SO₄). NO oxidizes to NO₂ (2NO + O₂ → 2NO₂),
    which reacts with water to form nitric acid (4NO₂ + O₂ + 2H₂O → 4HNO₃). These
    strong acids lower the pH of rainwater below 5.6.'

  question: What is the primary environmental effect of acid rain?
  options:
  - Increases soil fertility
  - Acidifies water bodies and damages aquatic ecosystems
  - Promotes plant growth
  - Neutralizes alkaline pollutants
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Acidifies water bodies and damages aquatic ecosystems
  explanation: 'Acid rain has several harmful environmental effects: **Aquatic ecosystems**:
    Acidification of lakes and rivers (pH drops below 5) kills fish, amphibians,
    and aquatic plants. Aluminum leaches from soil into water, becoming toxic to
    fish. **Vegetation and forests**: Direct damage to leaves and needles, leaching
    of essential nutrients (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, K⁺) from soil, mobilization of toxic Al³⁺
    ions that damage roots. **Buildings and monuments**: Corrosion of limestone (CaCO₃),
    marble, and metals. Famous example: Taj Mahal damage from Mathura refinery emissions.
    Reaction: CaCO₃ + H₂SO₄ → CaSO₄ + H₂O + CO₂. **Soil**: Depletion of nutrients,
    increased acidity affecting crop yields. Control measures include using low-sulfur
    fuels, installing scrubbers in smokestacks, catalytic converters in vehicles,
    and liming of acidified lakes.'
