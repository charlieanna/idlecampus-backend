  \ Chemistry\n\n    ## What is Green Chemistry?\n\n    **Definition**: Design of\
  \ chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation\
  \ of hazardous substances.\n\n    **Other names**: Sustainable chemistry, environmentally\
  \ benign chemistry\n\n    **Goal**: Prevention of pollution at the source rather\
  \ than treatment after generation.\n\n    ---\n\n    ## The 12 Principles of Green\
  \ Chemistry\n\n    ### 1. Prevention (Waste Prevention)\n    **Principle**: Prevent\
  \ waste rather than treat or clean up after it is formed.\n\n    **Example**:\n\
  \    - Design reactions with high yield and selectivity\n    - Minimize byproducts\n\
  \n    ### 2. Atom Economy\n    **Principle**: Design syntheses so maximum amount\
  \ of starting materials is incorporated into final product.\n\n    **Formula**:\n\
  \    \\\\[ \\\\text{Atom Economy} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Molar mass of desired product}}{\\\
  \\text{Sum of molar masses of all reactants}} \\\\times 100\\\\% \\\\]\n\n    **Example**:\n\
  \    - **Addition reactions** (high atom economy): A + B → AB (100%)\n    - **Substitution\
  \ reactions** (lower atom economy): A-B + C → A-C + B (waste B)\n\n    **IIT JEE\
  \ Example**:\n    - **Friedel-Crafts alkylation** (poor atom economy due to AlCl₃\
  \ waste)\n    - **Hydrogenation** (excellent atom economy)\n\n    ### 3. Less Hazardous\
  \ Chemical Syntheses\n    **Principle**: Use and generate substances with little\
  \ or no toxicity.\n\n    **Example**:\n    - Replace toxic phosgene (COCl₂) in polycarbonate\
  \ synthesis\n    - Avoid carcinogens, mutagens, teratogens\n\n    ### 4. Designing\
  \ Safer Chemicals\n    **Principle**: Design chemicals that are effective yet have\
  \ minimal toxicity.\n\n    **Example**:\n    - Biodegradable detergents (linear\
  \ alkyl benzene sulfonates)\n    - Water-based paints instead of solvent-based\n\
  \n    ### 5. Safer Solvents and Auxiliaries\n    **Principle**: Minimize or eliminate\
  \ auxiliary substances (solvents, separation agents).\n\n    **Green solvents**:\n\
  \    - **Water**: Best, safest solvent\n    - **Supercritical CO₂**: Non-toxic,\
  \ non-flammable (used in caffeine extraction)\n    - **Ionic liquids**: Non-volatile,\
  \ recyclable\n    - **Bio-based solvents**: Ethanol, ethyl lactate\n\n    **Avoid**:\n\
  \    - Chlorinated solvents (CHCl₃, CCl₄)\n    - Benzene (carcinogenic)\n\n    ###\
  \ 6. Design for Energy Efficiency\n    **Principle**: Minimize energy requirements\
  \ of chemical processes.\n\n    **Strategies**:\n    - Conduct reactions at room\
  \ temperature and pressure\n    - Avoid energy-intensive heating/cooling\n    -\
  \ Use catalysts to lower activation energy\n\n    **Example**:\n    - Enzymatic\
  \ reactions at mild conditions\n    - Microwave-assisted synthesis\n\n    ### 7.\
  \ Use of Renewable Feedstocks\n    **Principle**: Use renewable raw materials instead\
  \ of depleting fossil fuels.\n\n    **Examples**:\n    - **Biofuels**: Ethanol from\
  \ biomass\n    - **Bioplastics**: PLA (polylactic acid) from corn starch\n    -\
  \ **Bio-based chemicals**: Glycerol, levulinic acid\n\n    ### 8. Reduce Derivatives\n\
  \    **Principle**: Minimize derivatization (protection/deprotection steps) as they\
  \ require additional reagents and generate waste.\n\n    **Example**:\n    - Direct\
  \ functionalization instead of protection-deprotection\n    - Click chemistry (high\
  \ selectivity, no protection needed)\n\n    ### 9. Catalysis\n    **Principle**:\
  \ Use catalytic reagents (in small amounts) instead of stoichiometric reagents.\n\
  \n    **Advantages of catalysis**:\n    - Reduces waste\n    - Increases selectivity\n\
  \    - Lowers energy requirements\n\n    **Examples**:\n    - **Zeolites**: Solid\
  \ acid catalysts in petroleum cracking\n    - **Enzyme catalysis**: Biocatalysis\
  \ (mild conditions, high selectivity)\n    - **Transition metal catalysis**: Pd-catalyzed\
  \ cross-coupling\n\n    ### 10. Design for Degradation\n    **Principle**: Design\
  \ products to break down into innocuous substances after use.\n\n    **Examples**:\n\
  \    - **Biodegradable plastics**: PLA, PHB (polyhydroxybutyrate)\n    - **Green\
  \ pesticides**: Neem-based pesticides (degrade quickly)\n\n    **Avoid**:\n    -\
  \ Persistent pollutants (DDT, PCBs)\n\n    ### 11. Real-Time Analysis for Pollution\
  \ Prevention\n    **Principle**: Monitor reactions in real-time to prevent formation\
  \ of hazardous substances.\n\n    **Tools**:\n    - In-line sensors\n    - Process\
  \ analytical technology (PAT)\n    - Spectroscopy (IR, NMR) for monitoring\n\n \
  \   ### 12. Inherently Safer Chemistry for Accident Prevention\n    **Principle**:\
  \ Choose substances and processes to minimize accidents (explosions, fires, releases).\n\
  \n    **Strategies**:\n    - Use less hazardous reagents\n    - Lower temperatures\
  \ and pressures\n    - Avoid highly reactive intermediates\n\n    **Example**:\n\
  \    - Use aqueous H₂O₂ instead of organic peroxides (less explosive)\n\n    ---\n\

  question: What is atom economy in green chemistry, and why do addition reactions
    have better atom economy than substitution or elimination reactions?
  options:
  - Atom economy measures reaction speed; addition reactions are faster
  - Atom economy = (molar mass of desired product / sum of molar masses of all reactants)
    × 100%; addition reactions incorporate all reactant atoms (100%) while substitution/elimination
    produce waste byproducts
  - Atom economy only applies to organic reactions
  - Addition reactions use fewer catalysts than other reaction types
  correct_answer: Atom economy = (molar mass of desired product / sum of molar masses
    of all reactants) × 100%; addition reactions incorporate all reactant atoms (100%)
    while substitution/elimination produce waste byproducts
  explanation: 'Atom economy is a key green chemistry metric quantifying how efficiently
    reactant atoms are incorporated into the desired product, calculated as: Atom
    Economy = (Molar mass of desired product / Sum of molar masses of all reactants)
    × 100%. Higher atom economy means less waste. ADDITION REACTIONS achieve 100%
    atom economy because all atoms from reactants end up in the product. Example:
    Hydrogenation C₂H₄ + H₂ → C₂H₆. Reactant masses: 28 + 2 = 30 g/mol. Product: 30
    g/mol. Atom economy = 30/30 × 100% = 100%. No byproducts, perfect efficiency.
    This is the green chemistry ideal. SUBSTITUTION REACTIONS have lower atom economy
    because one group replaces another, creating a byproduct. Example: Chlorination
    CH₄ + Cl₂ → CH₃Cl + HCl. Desired product CH₃Cl = 50.5 g/mol. Reactants: 16 + 71
    = 87 g/mol. Atom economy = 50.5/87 × 100% = 58%. The HCl is waste (42% of atoms
    lost). ELIMINATION REACTIONS also waste atoms. Example: Dehydration C₂H₅OH → C₂H₄
    + H₂O. Desired product C₂H₄ = 28 g/mol. Reactant C₂H₅OH = 46 g/mol. Atom economy
    = 28/46 × 100% = 61%. Water is the lost 39%. Industrial implications: reactions
    with high atom economy reduce waste disposal costs, use fewer raw materials, and
    minimize environmental impact. The lesson emphasizes choosing reaction pathways
    with maximum atom economy - principle #2 of the 12 green chemistry principles.'

  question: Why is supercritical CO₂ considered a green solvent, and what are its
    applications in green chemistry?
  options:
  - It is cheap and abundant in the atmosphere
  - Above its critical point (31°C, 73 atm), it has properties of both liquid and
    gas, is non-toxic, non-flammable, and easily separable; used in decaffeination,
    dry cleaning, and extraction
  - It reacts with all organic compounds to form safe products
  - It works at room temperature and pressure
  correct_answer: Above its critical point (31°C, 73 atm), it has properties of both
    liquid and gas, is non-toxic, non-flammable, and easily separable; used in decaffeination,
    dry cleaning, and extraction
  explanation: 'Supercritical CO₂ (scCO₂) is a green solvent exemplifying Principle
    #5 (safer solvents and auxiliaries). Supercritical fluids exist above their critical
    temperature and pressure - for CO₂, this is 31°C and 73 atm (relatively mild conditions).
    In this state, scCO₂ has unique properties: density like a liquid (can dissolve
    substances), diffusivity like a gas (penetrates porous materials easily), low
    viscosity (flows easily), and tunable solvating power (adjust pressure to control
    dissolution). GREEN ADVANTAGES: (1) Non-toxic - CO₂ is naturally present in atmosphere
    and human body, safe to handle, (2) Non-flammable - crucial for industrial safety,
    eliminating fire/explosion risks associated with organic solvents, (3) Easily
    separable - reducing pressure returns CO₂ to gas, leaving pure extracted product
    with no solvent residue, (4) Recyclable - captured CO₂ gas can be recompressed
    and reused, (5) Environmentally benign - no VOC emissions, no toxic waste. APPLICATIONS
    from the lesson: (1) Decaffeination of coffee - extracts caffeine from beans without
    toxic solvents like dichloromethane, (2) Dry cleaning - replaces perchloroethylene
    (perc), a toxic, carcinogenic solvent, (3) Extraction of essential oils, fragrances,
    flavors from plant materials, (4) Pharmaceutical purification. Compare to traditional
    solvents: benzene (carcinogenic), chloroform (toxic), hexane (neurotoxic) - scCO₂
    eliminates these hazards. Limitations: requires high-pressure equipment (capital
    cost), not suitable for all solutes. Overall, scCO₂ exemplifies designing greener
    processes.'

  question: 'Why is catalysis (Principle #9) considered central to green chemistry,
    and how do zeolites exemplify this principle?'
  options:
  - Catalysts are expensive so using them makes products more valuable
  - Catalysts work in small amounts (not stoichiometric), increase selectivity, reduce
    waste, and lower energy requirements; zeolites are solid acid catalysts replacing
    corrosive liquid acids like H₂SO₄
  - Catalysts permanently bond to products making them safer
  - All catalysts are natural and biodegradable
  correct_answer: Catalysts work in small amounts (not stoichiometric), increase selectivity,
    reduce waste, and lower energy requirements; zeolites are solid acid catalysts
    replacing corrosive liquid acids like H₂SO₄
  explanation: 'Catalysis is Principle #9: "Use catalytic reagents (in small amounts)
    instead of stoichiometric reagents." Catalysts are central to green chemistry
    because they provide multiple green benefits simultaneously. STOICHIOMETRY: Traditional
    reagents are used in stoichiometric amounts (1:1 or greater molar ratios with
    reactants) and are consumed, creating equivalent amounts of waste. Catalysts work
    in tiny amounts (often <1% by mass) and are regenerated, so 1 gram of catalyst
    can process kilograms of reactants. This dramatically reduces waste. SELECTIVITY:
    Catalysts often increase selectivity, producing more of the desired product and
    fewer byproducts, improving atom economy. ENERGY EFFICIENCY: Catalysts lower activation
    energy (Ea), enabling reactions at lower temperatures and pressures, reducing
    energy consumption (also Principle #6). ZEOLITES exemplify green catalysis. They
    are microporous aluminosilicates (natural or synthetic minerals) acting as solid
    acid catalysts. GREEN ADVANTAGES: (1) Replace corrosive liquid acids (H₂SO₄, HF,
    H₃PO₄) which are hazardous, difficult to handle, and generate acid waste requiring
    neutralization, (2) Heterogeneous (solid) - easily separated from reaction mixture
    by filtration (no contamination of product), recyclable for multiple uses, (3)
    Shape-selective - pore sizes (molecular dimensions) control which molecules enter/react,
    providing high selectivity, (4) Non-toxic and non-corrosive - safer for workers
    and environment. APPLICATIONS: Petroleum refining (catalytic cracking of long
    hydrocarbons to gasoline), isomerization reactions, conversion of methanol to
    gasoline (ZSM-5 zeolite). The lesson states zeolites "replace corrosive liquid
    acids" - this single substitution eliminates tons of hazardous acid waste in petroleum
    and chemical industries, exemplifying green chemistry''s principle of "benign
    by design."'
