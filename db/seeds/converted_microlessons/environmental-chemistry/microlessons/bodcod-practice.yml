  TRUE. COD measures total organic and inorganic matter (chemical oxidation), while
  BOD measures only biodegradable organic matter (biological oxidation). Therefore,
  COD ≥ BOD always.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the relationship between COD and BOD for the same water sample?
  options:
  - COD < BOD always
  - COD ≥ BOD always
  - COD = BOD always
  - No relationship exists
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: COD ≥ BOD always
  explanation: 'COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) is **always greater than or equal to**
    BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) for the same water sample: COD ≥ BOD. **Reasons**:
    **BOD** measures only biodegradable organic matter that can be oxidized by microorganisms
    (biological oxidation over 5 days at 20°C). **COD** measures total organic and
    inorganic matter that can be chemically oxidized by strong oxidizing agents (K₂Cr₂O₇
    in acidic medium). COD includes: All biodegradable organic matter (measured by
    BOD), Non-biodegradable organic matter (e.g., lignin, cellulose, plastics), Some
    inorganic reducing agents (Fe²⁺, S²⁻, Cl⁻). Therefore, COD ≥ BOD. The **COD/BOD
    ratio** indicates biodegradability: Ratio < 2: Highly biodegradable (domestic
    sewage), Ratio 2-5: Moderately biodegradable, Ratio > 5: Low biodegradability
    (industrial waste with toxic/refractory compounds).'

  question: Which test provides faster results for measuring water pollution?
  options:
  - BOD test (5 days)
  - COD test (2-3 hours)
  - Both take equal time
  - Neither can measure pollution
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: COD test (2-3 hours)
  explanation: '**COD test** provides much faster results (2-3 hours) compared to
    **BOD test** (5 days). This is a major advantage for rapid water quality assessment.
    **BOD test**: Takes 5 days at 20°C, relies on slow microbial decomposition, labor-intensive
    (requires careful DO measurements), susceptible to bacterial variability. **COD
    test**: Takes only 2-3 hours, uses strong chemical oxidants (K₂Cr₂O₇ + H₂SO₄
    at high temperature), more reproducible and reliable, measures both biodegradable
    and non-biodegradable matter. **Applications**: COD is preferred for: Industrial
    wastewater monitoring (faster compliance checking), Toxic waste (where microorganisms
    may not survive), Process control in treatment plants. BOD is preferred for:
    Assessing biodegradable pollution, Determining treatment efficiency, Natural water
    bodies monitoring. Often both tests are performed: COD for quick screening, BOD
    for detailed assessment.'

  question: In the COD test, which oxidizing agent is commonly used?
  options:
  - KMnO₄ in acidic medium
  - K₂Cr₂O₇ in acidic medium
  - H₂O₂ in basic medium
  - Cl₂ gas
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: K₂Cr₂O₇ in acidic medium
  explanation: '**Potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇) in acidic medium** is the standard
    oxidizing agent used in COD test. **Test procedure**: (1) Add excess K₂Cr₂O₇
    and concentrated H₂SO₄ to water sample, (2) Add Ag₂SO₄ (catalyst) and HgSO₄
    (to complex chloride ions that interfere), (3) Reflux at 150°C for 2 hours, (4)
    Cool and titrate excess dichromate with standard ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS)
    using ferroin indicator, (5) Calculate COD from amount of dichromate consumed.
    **Reaction**: Organic matter + Cr₂O₇²⁻ + H⁺ → Cr³⁺ + CO₂ + H₂O (orange Cr₂O₇²⁻
    reduced to green Cr³⁺). **Why K₂Cr₂O₇?**: Strong oxidizing agent (oxidizes 95-100%
    of organic matter), stable and easy to standardize, color change (orange → green)
    aids visual detection. **Alternative**: KMnO₄ is used in older methods but less
    preferred due to instability and lower oxidizing power.'
