  Atom economy = (Molar mass of product / Sum of molar masses of reactants) × 100%
  = (30 / (28 + 2)) × 100% = (30/30) × 100% = 100%. This is an addition reaction with
  perfect atom economy.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: 'Calculate the atom economy for: C₂H₄ + H₂ → C₂H₆'
  options:
  - 75%
  - 100%
  - 50%
  - 93.3%
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 100%
  explanation: 'Atom economy measures the efficiency of a reaction in converting reactants
    to desired products. Formula: Atom economy = (Molar mass of desired product /
    Sum of molar masses of all reactants) × 100%. For C₂H₄ + H₂ → C₂H₆: Molar mass
    of C₂H₆ = 2(12) + 6(1) = 30 g/mol, Molar mass of C₂H₄ = 2(12) + 4(1) = 28 g/mol,
    Molar mass of H₂ = 2(1) = 2 g/mol. Sum of reactants = 28 + 2 = 30 g/mol. Atom
    economy = (30/30) × 100% = 100%. This is an addition reaction where all atoms
    from reactants are incorporated into the product with zero waste. Addition reactions
    typically have 100% atom economy, making them environmentally friendly. Substitution
    reactions generally have lower atom economy due to by-products.'

  question: Which type of reaction typically has the highest atom economy?
  options:
  - Substitution reactions
  - Addition reactions
  - Elimination reactions
  - Combustion reactions
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Addition reactions
  explanation: 'Addition reactions typically have the highest atom economy (often
    100%) because all atoms from all reactants are incorporated into a single product
    with no by-products or waste. Examples: Hydrogenation (C₂H₄ + H₂ → C₂H₆), Hydration
    (C₂H₄ + H₂O → C₂H₅OH). In contrast: **Substitution reactions** produce by-products,
    reducing atom economy. Example: CH₄ + Cl₂ → CH₃Cl + HCl (HCl is waste). **Elimination
    reactions** produce small molecules as by-products. Example: C₂H₅OH → C₂H₄ +
    H₂O. **Combustion reactions** produce CO₂ and H₂O, with very low atom economy
    for most purposes. Green chemistry principle #2 emphasizes designing syntheses
    with maximum atom economy to minimize waste. High atom economy reduces raw material
    costs, waste disposal costs, and environmental impact.'

  question: 'For the reaction: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂, if CaO is the desired product,
    what is the atom economy?'
  options:
  - 100%
  - 56%
  - 44%
  - 80%
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 56%
  explanation: 'Atom economy = (Molar mass of desired product / Molar mass of reactant)
    × 100%. For thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate: CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂. Given
    CaO is the desired product: Molar mass of CaO = 40 + 16 = 56 g/mol, Molar mass
    of CaCO₃ = 40 + 12 + 3(16) = 100 g/mol. Atom economy = (56/100) × 100% = 56%.
    This means 44% of the mass becomes waste (CO₂). Decomposition reactions typically
    have low atom economy. This reaction is used industrially to produce quicklime
    (CaO) for cement production, but the low atom economy means significant waste.
    In industry, the waste CO₂ can sometimes be captured and used, improving overall
    process efficiency. Note: For thermal decomposition, we only consider the reactant
    mass, not products like heat.'
