  Green chemistry principles include: catalysis (Principle 9), design for degradation
  (Principle 10), and prevention (Principle 1). Chlorinated solvents are hazardous
  and should be avoided (Principle 5: safer solvents).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following are examples of green chemistry principles?
  options:
  - Use of catalysts instead of stoichiometric reagents
  - Design of biodegradable products
  - Use of chlorinated solvents for efficiency
  - Prevention of waste at source
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Prevention of waste at source
  explanation: 'The 12 Principles of Green Chemistry include: **Principle 1: Prevention**
    - It is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it is created
    (most fundamental principle). **Principle 9: Catalysis** - Catalytic reagents
    (used in small amounts and recycled) are superior to stoichiometric reagents (used
    in large amounts and discarded). **Principle 10: Design for Degradation** - Chemical
    products should be designed to break down into innocuous substances after use,
    not persist in the environment. **Principle 5: Safer Solvents** - Avoid hazardous
    solvents like chlorinated hydrocarbons (carcinogenic, ozone-depleting); use water,
    supercritical CO₂, or ionic liquids instead. All these principles aim to make
    chemistry more sustainable and less harmful to human health and the environment.'

  question: Which solvent is considered "green" and environmentally friendly?
  options:
  - Carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄)
  - Benzene (C₆H₆)
  - Supercritical CO₂
  - Chloroform (CHCl₃)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Supercritical CO₂
  explanation: '**Supercritical CO₂** is considered a green solvent (Principle 5:
    Safer Solvents and Auxiliaries). **Properties of supercritical CO₂**: Non-toxic,
    non-flammable, readily available (by-product of industrial processes), easily
    removed (by releasing pressure, it evaporates), tunable solvent power (by adjusting
    temperature and pressure), recyclable. **Applications**: Decaffeination of coffee,
    dry cleaning (replacing perchloroethylene), extraction of natural products, polymer
    processing. **Other green solvents**: Water (most abundant, safest), ionic liquids
    (low vapor pressure, non-volatile), ethanol, ethyl lactate (biodegradable), polyethylene
    glycol (PEG). **Hazardous solvents to avoid**: **Carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄)**:
    Ozone-depleting, carcinogenic, hepatotoxic (banned under Montreal Protocol).
    **Benzene (C₆H₆)**: Carcinogenic, causes leukemia. **Chloroform (CHCl₃)**: Hepatotoxic,
    probable carcinogen, ozone-depleting. Traditional organic solvents (dichloromethane,
    toluene, hexane) have high VOC emissions and health hazards. Green chemistry
    aims to replace these with safer alternatives.'

  question: What is the primary goal of "atom economy" in green chemistry?
  options:
  - Maximize profit from chemical reactions
  - Minimize waste by incorporating all reactants into the final product
  - Increase reaction speed
  - Reduce energy consumption only
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Minimize waste by incorporating all reactants into the final product
  explanation: '**Atom economy** (Principle 2) aims to **minimize waste by maximizing
    the incorporation of all reactant atoms into the desired product**. Formula:
    Atom economy = (Molecular weight of desired product / Sum of molecular weights
    of all reactants) × 100%. **Why important?**: Reduces raw material costs, minimizes
    waste generation and disposal, conserves resources, lowers environmental impact.
    **Reaction types and atom economy**: **Addition reactions**: 100% atom economy
    (all atoms incorporated). Example: C₂H₄ + H₂ → C₂H₆. **Rearrangement reactions**:
    100% atom economy. Example: Isomerization. **Substitution reactions**: Lower
    atom economy (by-products formed). Example: CH₄ + Cl₂ → CH₃Cl + HCl (atom economy
    = 70%). **Elimination reactions**: Lower atom economy. **Industrial example**:
    Traditional synthesis of adipic acid (for nylon) from benzene has low atom economy
    (~50%). Green alternative: Direct oxidation using air/O₂ with catalysts achieves
    higher atom economy. Atom economy complements **yield** (measures how much product
    is actually obtained vs. theoretical).'
