  Pollution factor = 18 / 5 = 3.6. The water sample is 3.6 times more polluted than
  the upper limit of clean water. Water with BOD > 15 ppm is considered highly polluted.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: A water sample has BOD of 18 ppm. The upper limit for clean water is
    5 ppm. By what factor is this water more polluted?
  options:
  - '2.6'
  - '3.6'
  - '4.0'
  - '1.8'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '3.6'
  explanation: 'BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand) measures the amount of oxygen required
    by aerobic microorganisms to decompose organic matter in water over 5 days at
    20°C. It indicates the level of organic pollution. Pollution factor = (BOD of
    sample) / (Upper limit for clean water) = 18 ppm / 5 ppm = 3.6. The water is
    3.6 times more polluted than the maximum acceptable level for clean water. **BOD
    classification**: BOD < 5 ppm: Clean water, suitable for drinking (with treatment).
    BOD 5-15 ppm: Moderately polluted, suitable for bathing. BOD 15-30 ppm: Highly
    polluted, unsuitable for most uses. BOD > 30 ppm: Severely polluted, nearly septic.
    At BOD = 18 ppm, this water is highly polluted and cannot be used for drinking
    or bathing without extensive treatment.'

  question: What does a high BOD value indicate about a water sample?
  options:
  - Low organic pollution and good water quality
  - High organic pollution and poor water quality
  - High dissolved oxygen and clean water
  - Low microbial activity
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: High organic pollution and poor water quality
  explanation: 'A high BOD value indicates **high organic pollution** and **poor
    water quality**. Here''s why: When organic matter (sewage, agricultural runoff,
    industrial waste) enters water, aerobic bacteria decompose it using dissolved
    oxygen. High organic content means bacteria need more oxygen, resulting in high
    BOD. Consequences of high BOD: (1) **Oxygen depletion**: Rapid consumption of
    dissolved oxygen, (2) **Hypoxia/Anoxia**: Oxygen levels drop below what fish
    and aquatic animals need (typically < 5 mg/L), (3) **Fish kills**: Aquatic life
    dies due to lack of oxygen, (4) **Anaerobic conditions**: In severe cases, water
    becomes anaerobic, producing foul-smelling compounds (H₂S, CH₄). Sources of high
    BOD: untreated sewage, food processing waste, paper mill effluents, agricultural
    runoff. BOD is a key water quality parameter used to assess pollution and design
    wastewater treatment systems.'

  question: 'BOD test is conducted at which standard conditions?'
  options:
  - 25°C for 3 days
  - 20°C for 5 days
  - 30°C for 7 days
  - 15°C for 10 days
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 20°C for 5 days
  explanation: 'The standard BOD test (BOD₅) is conducted at **20°C for 5 days**.
    This is an internationally standardized protocol (ISO, APHA methods). **Why these
    conditions?**: **Temperature (20°C)**: Represents average environmental temperature,
    optimal for aerobic bacterial activity, standardizes results for comparison across
    different locations. **Duration (5 days)**: By day 5, typically 60-70% of biodegradable
    organic matter is oxidized (first stage of decomposition), balances practical
    time constraints with meaningful results, approximates natural decomposition
    rate in rivers/lakes. **Test procedure**: (1) Measure initial dissolved oxygen
    (DO₁), (2) Incubate water sample in dark at 20°C for 5 days (dark prevents photosynthetic
    oxygen production by algae), (3) Measure final dissolved oxygen (DO₂), (4) BOD₅
    = DO₁ - DO₂. Ultimate BOD (BOD₂₀ or BOD∞) measures oxygen demand over 20+ days
    but is impractical for routine testing.'
