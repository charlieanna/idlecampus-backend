  question: 'How many atoms are present per unit cell in a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure?'
  options:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 4
  - 6
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 4
  explanation: 'FCC has 4 atoms per unit cell. Calculation: (1) Corner atoms: 8 corners × 1/8 atom/corner = 1 atom (each corner atom is shared by 8 unit cells), (2) Face-centered atoms: 6 faces × 1/2 atom/face = 3 atoms (each face atom is shared by 2 unit cells), (3) Total: 1 + 3 = 4 atoms per unit cell. This is important for calculating: (1) Density of crystals: ρ = (Z × M)/(a³ × Nₐ), where Z = atoms/unit cell, (2) Coordination number: FCC has CN = 12, (3) Packing efficiency: 74%. Examples of FCC metals: Cu, Ag, Au, Al, Ni, Pb, Pt. Comparison: SC has 1 atom/cell, BCC has 2 atoms/cell, FCC has 4 atoms/cell. The number of atoms per unit cell affects material properties like density, atomic radius calculations, and crystal structure determination from X-ray diffraction data.'

  question: 'In a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal, the atoms touch along which direction?'
  options:
  - Edge of the cube
  - Face diagonal
  - Body diagonal
  - Corner to corner
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Body diagonal
  explanation: 'In BCC structure, atoms touch along the body diagonal of the unit cell. The body diagonal passes through: corner atom → body center atom → opposite corner atom. Relationship: Body diagonal length = 4r (where r = atomic radius), Body diagonal = √3a (where a = edge length), Therefore: 4r = √3a, giving r = √3a/4. This is crucial for calculating atomic radius from unit cell dimensions. Comparison: (1) Simple Cubic (SC): atoms touch along edges, so 2r = a, (2) BCC: atoms touch along body diagonal, so 4r = √3a, (3) FCC: atoms touch along face diagonal, so 4r = √2a. Understanding where atoms touch is essential for: (1) Determining atomic radii from X-ray crystallography data, (2) Calculating packing efficiency, (3) Understanding coordination number. BCC has CN = 8 because the central atom touches 8 corner atoms along body diagonals.'

  question: 'What type of solid is characterized by the presence of delocalized electrons throughout the structure?'
  options:
  - Ionic solid
  - Molecular solid
  - Metallic solid
  - Covalent network solid
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Metallic solid
  explanation: 'Metallic solids are characterized by delocalized electrons (electron sea model). In metals: (1) Valence electrons are not bound to specific atoms but move freely throughout the crystal structure, (2) This "sea of electrons" holds metal cations together through metallic bonding, (3) Delocalized electrons explain metallic properties: electrical conductivity (electrons carry charge), thermal conductivity (electrons transfer energy), malleability and ductility (electron sea allows atomic layers to slide), luster (electrons interact with light). Comparison of solid types: (1) Ionic: localized electrons, transferred from metal to nonmetal, high melting points, conductive when molten, (2) Molecular: localized electrons in covalent bonds, weak intermolecular forces, low melting points, (3) Metallic: delocalized electrons, high conductivity, variable melting points, (4) Covalent network: localized electrons in extensive covalent network, very high melting points (e.g., diamond, SiO₂). Examples of metallic solids: Na, Fe, Cu, Au.'
