  # Friction on Inclined Planes

  ## Forces on Inclined Plane

  For mass m on plane inclined at angle θ:

  ### Component Analysis:
  ```
  Along incline (down): mg sin θ
  Perpendicular to incline: mg cos θ
  Normal force: N = mg cos θ
  Friction force: f ≤ μN = μmg cos θ
  ```

  ## Angle of Repose (α)

  **Definition:** Maximum angle at which object remains at rest on inclined plane.

  ```
  tan α = μₛ (static friction coefficient)

  α = tan⁻¹(μₛ)
  ```

  ### When θ < α:
  - Object remains stationary
  - f < μₛN (static friction adjusts)
  - f = mg sin θ (just enough to prevent sliding)

  ### When θ = α:
  - Limiting friction reached
  - f = μₛN = mg sin θ
  - Object about to slide

  ### When θ > α:
  - Object slides down
  - Kinetic friction applies
  - a = g(sin θ - μₖ cos θ)

  ## Different Cases

  ### Case 1: Object at Rest (θ < α)
  ```
  Friction force: f = mg sin θ
  Normal force: N = mg cos θ
  Acceleration: a = 0
  ```

  ### Case 2: Object Sliding Down (θ > α)
  ```
  Net force = mg sin θ - μₖ mg cos θ
  a = g(sin θ - μₖ cos θ)
  ```

  ### Case 3: Object Pushed Up
  ```
  Net force = mg sin θ + μₖ mg cos θ (both oppose motion)
  a = -g(sin θ + μₖ cos θ) (deceleration)
  ```

  ### Case 4: Object Moving Up with Initial Velocity
  - First decelerates: a = -g(sin θ + μₖ cos θ)
  - Stops at highest point
  - May stay or slide back depending on θ vs α

  ## Key Formulas

  ### Acceleration Down the Plane:
  ```
  a = g sin θ (frictionless)
  a = g(sin θ - μₖ cos θ) (with friction)
  ```

  ### Velocity at Bottom:
  ```
  v = √(2gh) (frictionless)
  v = √(2as) where s = h/sin θ
  ```

  ### Time to Slide Down:
  ```
  t = √(2s/a) = √(2h/(a sin θ))
  ```

  ### Critical Angle for Motion:
  ```
  θ_critical = tan⁻¹(μₛ)
  ```

  ## Special Situations

  ### 1. Minimum Force to Push Up:
  ```
  F_min = mg(sin θ + μₛ cos θ)
  ```
  Applied parallel to incline

  ### 2. Maximum Force Before Sliding Up:
  ```
  F_max = mg(sin θ + μₛ cos θ)
  ```

  ### 3. Force to Prevent Sliding Down:
  ```
  F = mg(sin θ - μₛ cos θ)
  ```
  If negative, object won't slide anyway.

  ### 4. Force at Angle to Incline:
  Resolve force into components, then analyze.

  ## Connected Systems on Incline

  ### Two Blocks Connected by String:
  ```
  Block 1 (on incline): T - m₁g sin θ - f₁ = m₁a
  Block 2 (hanging): m₂g - T = m₂a
  ```

  ### Block on Block (on incline):
  - Check if they move together
  - Find maximum acceleration without slipping
  - Analyze limiting friction between blocks

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** A block on 30° incline has μₛ = 0.6 and μₖ = 0.5. Will it slide? If yes, find acceleration.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  Angle of repose: α = tan⁻¹(0.6) ≈ 31°
  Since θ = 30° < α = 31°, block won't slide.

  If somehow started moving:
  a = g(sin 30° - 0.5 cos 30°)
  a = 10(0.5 - 0.5 × 0.866)
  a = 10(0.5 - 0.433) = 0.67 m/s²
  ```

  **Example 2:** Block slides down 45° incline with a = 2.5 m/s². Find μₖ.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  a = g(sin θ - μₖ cos θ)
  2.5 = 10(sin 45° - μₖ cos 45°)
  2.5 = 10(1/√2 - μₖ/√2)
  0.25 = (1 - μₖ)/√2
  1 - μₖ = 0.25√2 ≈ 0.354
  μₖ = 0.646
  ```

  **Example 3:** A 2 kg block on 37° incline is connected by string over pulley to 3 kg hanging mass. If μₖ = 0.25, find acceleration.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  For 2 kg on incline (moving up):
  T - 2g sin 37° - μₖ(2g cos 37°) = 2a
  T - 12 - 4 = 2a
  T - 16 = 2a ... (1)

  For 3 kg (moving down):
  3g - T = 3a
  30 - T = 3a ... (2)

  Adding: 14 = 5a
  a = 2.8 m/s²
  T = 30 - 8.4 = 21.6 N
  ```

  ## JEE Important Points

  1. **Always resolve forces** along and perpendicular to incline
  2. **N ≠ mg on incline** (N = mg cos θ)
  3. **Friction opposes relative motion** (up or down the incline)
  4. **Check θ vs angle of repose** before assuming motion
  5. **Different accelerations** going up vs coming down

  question: "A block rests on a 30° incline. If μₛ = 0.6, the frictional force acting on it is: (mass = 2 kg, g = 10 m/s²)"
  options:
  - "12 N"
  - "10 N"
  - "10.4 N"
  - "6 N"
  correct_answer: "10 N"
  explanation: "Since tan 30° = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577 < μₛ = 0.6, block doesn't slide. Friction = mg sin 30° = 2 × 10 × 0.5 = 10 N. This is less than maximum possible friction: f_max = μₛN = 0.6 × 2 × 10 × cos 30° = 0.6 × 20 × 0.866 ≈ 10.4 N. Static friction adjusts to exactly balance component of weight along incline. If you mistakenly use f = μₛN = 10.4 N, you'd be wrong - that's only the maximum possible, not actual value. Key: For equilibrium, f = mg sin θ, NOT μₛN."

  question: "A block slides down a frictionless incline of length 10 m and height 5 m. Its speed at bottom is:"
  options:
  - "5 m/s"
  - "10 m/s"
  - "7.07 m/s"
  - "14.14 m/s"
  correct_answer: "10 m/s"
  explanation: "Using energy conservation: mgh = ½mv². So v = √(2gh) = √(2 × 10 × 5) = √100 = 10 m/s. Note: This is independent of incline angle or length! Whether incline is 30° or 60°, if height is 5 m, final speed is 10 m/s. The length (10 m) is given but not needed for frictionless case. If friction existed, we'd need length: Work by friction = μₖmg cos θ × L, and v² = 2gh - 2μₖgL cos θ. This demonstrates power of energy methods over force analysis."

  question: "The angle of repose for a rough inclined plane is 45°. The coefficient of static friction is:"
  options:
  - "0.5"
  - "1.0"
  - "0.707"
  - "1.414"
  correct_answer: "1.0"
  explanation: "At angle of repose α, mg sin α = μₛmg cos α. Therefore tan α = μₛ. Given α = 45°, μₛ = tan 45° = 1.0. This means friction force can be as large as normal force. Physical interpretation: At 45°, both components (along and perpendicular to incline) are equal: mg sin 45° = mg cos 45° = mg/√2. For block to just remain stationary, friction must equal parallel component, requiring μₛ = 1. Materials with μₛ ≥ 1 are rare but exist (rubber on rubber, some adhesives)."
