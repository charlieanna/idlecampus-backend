  # Circular Motion and Centripetal Force

  ## Uniform Circular Motion

  **Motion in a circle with constant speed.**

  ### Parameters:
  ```
  Angular displacement: θ (radians)
  Angular velocity: ω = dθ/dt (rad/s)
  Time period: T = 2π/ω
  Frequency: f = 1/T = ω/(2π)
  Linear velocity: v = rω
  ```

  ## Centripetal Acceleration

  **Direction:** Always towards center of circle.

  ```
  a_c = v²/r = rω² = vω

  Magnitude constant, direction continuously changes
  ```

  ### Important:
  - Speed is constant but velocity changes (direction changes)
  - Acceleration exists even with constant speed
  - Acceleration perpendicular to velocity

  ## Centripetal Force

  **Force required to maintain circular motion:**

  ```
  F_c = ma_c = mv²/r = mrω² = mvω

  Direction: Always radially inward (towards center)
  ```

  ### Sources:
  - Tension (stone on string)
  - Friction (car on road)
  - Gravity (satellite)
  - Normal force (wall of death)
  - Combination of forces

  ## Non-Uniform Circular Motion

  When speed changes along circle:
  ```
  Tangential acceleration: a_t = dv/dt
  Centripetal acceleration: a_c = v²/r (radial)

  Total: a = √(a_t² + a_c²)
  ```

  ## Vertical Circular Motion

  ### Critical Points:

  **At Highest Point:**
  ```
  mg + T = mv²/r (both forces towards center)
  T_top = mv²/r - mg

  Minimum speed (T = 0): v_min = √(gr)
  ```

  **At Lowest Point:**
  ```
  T - mg = mv²/r (T towards center, mg away)
  T_bottom = mv²/r + mg

  Maximum tension at bottom!
  ```

  ### Minimum Speed at Bottom (for complete loop):
  ```
  v_bottom = √(5gr)

  Using energy conservation from top to bottom.
  ```

  ## Motion on Banked Road

  ### Without Friction:
  ```
  tan θ = v²/(rg)

  θ = banking angle
  v = optimum speed
  r = radius of curve
  ```

  At this speed, no friction needed.

  ### With Friction:
  ```
  Maximum speed: v_max = √(rg(μ + tan θ)/(1 - μ tan θ))
  Minimum speed: v_min = √(rg(tan θ - μ)/(1 + μ tan θ))
  ```

  ## Conical Pendulum

  Bob revolves in horizontal circle:
  ```
  T cos θ = mg (vertical balance)
  T sin θ = mv²/r = mrω² (centripetal)

  tan θ = v²/(rg) = rω²/g

  Time period: T = 2π√(L cos θ/g)
  ```

  ## Centrifugal Force (Pseudo Force)

  In rotating frame of reference:
  ```
  F_cf = mrω² = mv²/r

  Direction: Radially outward (away from center)
  ```

  ### Important:
  - Not a real force (pseudo/fictitious)
  - Appears only in rotating (non-inertial) frame
  - Magnitude equals centripetal force

  ## Applications

  ### 1. Car on Curved Road:
  ```
  Friction provides centripetal force
  f = mv²/r ≤ μmg
  v_max = √(μgr)
  ```

  ### 2. Cyclist Leaning:
  ```
  tan θ = v²/(rg)
  θ = angle of lean from vertical
  ```

  ### 3. Aircraft Banking:
  ```
  tan θ = v²/(rg)
  Lift provides centripetal component
  ```

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Stone of 0.5 kg on 1 m string rotated at 2 rev/s. Find tension.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  ω = 2 × 2π = 4π rad/s
  T = mrω² = 0.5 × 1 × (4π)²
  T = 0.5 × 16π² ≈ 0.5 × 158 ≈ 79 N

  Much larger than weight (5 N)!
  ```

  **Example 2:** Car on banked road at angle 30°. Find speed for no friction (r = 100 m).

  **Solution:**
  ```
  tan θ = v²/(rg)
  tan 30° = v²/(100 × 10)
  1/√3 = v²/1000
  v² = 1000/√3 ≈ 577
  v ≈ 24 m/s ≈ 86 km/h
  ```

  **Example 3:** Minimum speed at top of vertical loop of radius 10 m?

  **Solution:**
  ```
  v_min = √(gr) = √(10 × 10) = 10 m/s

  Below this speed, object falls off at top.
  At bottom: v = √(5gr) = √500 ≈ 22.4 m/s needed.
  ```

  ## JEE Key Points

  1. **F_c = mv²/r** (towards center)
  2. **Centripetal is not a force type** - it's the net radial force
  3. **v_min at top** = √(gr)
  4. **Banking:** tan θ = v²/(rg)
  5. **T_bottom > T_top** in vertical circle
  6. **Centrifugal is pseudo force** (non-inertial frame)

  question: "A particle moves in circle of radius r with constant speed v. In half revolution, magnitude of average velocity is:"
  options:
  - "v"
  - "2v/π"
  - "πv/2"
  - "0"
  correct_answer: "2v/π"
  explanation: "Distance covered in half revolution = πr (half circumference). Time taken = πr/v. Displacement = 2r (diameter, straight line). Average velocity = Displacement/Time = 2r/(πr/v) = 2v/π. Note: Average SPEED = Distance/Time = πr/(πr/v) = v (equals instantaneous speed). Average velocity < average speed always in curved motion. For full revolution: displacement = 0, so average velocity = 0, but average speed = v. This distinction between velocity (vector) and speed (scalar) is crucial for circular motion problems."

  question: "A stone tied to string is whirled in vertical circle. At which point is tension maximum?"
  options:
  - "Highest point"
  - "Lowest point"
  - "Horizontal position"
  - "Same at all points"
  correct_answer: "Lowest point"
  explanation: "At bottom: T - mg = mv²/r, so T = mv²/r + mg. At top: T + mg = mv²/r, so T = mv²/r - mg. At bottom, tension supports weight PLUS provides centripetal force. At top, weight helps provide centripetal force, reducing T. Also, speed is maximum at bottom (energy conservation), making v²/r term largest. If v_bottom = √(5gr) (minimum for complete circle), then T_bottom = 6mg while T_top = 0. Ratio is 6:0! String most likely to break at bottom. This is why circus performers feel heaviest at bottom of loop."

  question: "A car travels on banked road with banking angle θ = 45°. For motion without friction, speed must be:"
  options:
  - "√(rg)"
  - "√(2rg)"
  - "√(rg/2)"
  - "rg"
  correct_answer: "√(rg)"
  explanation: "For no friction: tan θ = v²/(rg). At θ = 45°: tan 45° = 1 = v²/(rg). Therefore v² = rg, v = √(rg). At this optimal speed, horizontal component of normal force exactly provides required centripetal force. Below this speed, car slides down; above, slides up (friction needed). Example: r = 100 m, g = 10 m/s². v = √1000 ≈ 31.6 m/s ≈ 114 km/h. Race tracks are banked to allow high speeds safely. Banking reduces reliance on friction, important for wet conditions. Steeper banking allows higher optimal speed."
