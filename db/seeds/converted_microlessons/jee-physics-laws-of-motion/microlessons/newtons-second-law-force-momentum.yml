  # Newton's Second Law: Force and Momentum

  ## Statement

  **"The rate of change of linear momentum of a body is directly proportional to the net external force applied and occurs in the direction of the force."**

  ## Mathematical Formulation

  ### General Form (Most Fundamental):
  ```
  F⃗ = dp⃗/dt = d(mv⃗)/dt
  ```

  ### For Constant Mass:
  ```
  F⃗ = m(dv⃗/dt) = ma⃗
  ```

  ### For Variable Mass (Rocket Equation):
  ```
  F⃗ = m(dv⃗/dt) + v⃗_rel(dm/dt)
  ```

  ## Linear Momentum

  **Definition:** p⃗ = mv⃗

  **Properties:**
  - Vector quantity
  - Direction same as velocity
  - SI unit: kg·m/s or N·s
  - Dimensions: [MLT⁻¹]

  ## Impulse

  **Definition:** J⃗ = ∫F⃗ dt = Δp⃗

  **Impulse-Momentum Theorem:**
  ```
  J⃗ = p⃗_f - p⃗_i = mΔv⃗
  ```

  **Average Force:**
  ```
  F⃗_avg = Δp⃗/Δt = J⃗/Δt
  ```

  ## Important Applications

  ### 1. Recoil of Gun
  ```
  m_bullet × v_bullet = -M_gun × V_gun
  (Conservation of momentum: initial momentum = 0)
  ```

  ### 2. Water Jet on Wall
  ```
  F = ρAv² (perpendicular jet)
  F = 2ρAv² (jet bouncing back)
  ```

  ### 3. Sand Falling on Conveyor Belt
  ```
  F = v(dm/dt)
  Power = Fv = v²(dm/dt)
  ```

  ### 4. Rocket Propulsion
  ```
  F_thrust = -v_rel(dm/dt) = v_rel × (rate of fuel burn)

  Rocket equation:
  v = u + v_rel ln(m₀/m)
  ```

  ## JEE Important Concepts

  ### 1. Force as Rate of Momentum Change
  - More general than F = ma
  - Applies to variable mass systems
  - Foundation of rocket mechanics

  ### 2. Impulse in Collisions
  - Equal impulse on both colliding bodies (Newton's third law)
  - Opposite directions
  - Independent of collision time

  ### 3. Average vs Instantaneous Force
  ```
  F_avg = Δp/Δt (over finite time)
  F_inst = dp/dt (at an instant)
  ```

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** A 50g ball hits wall at 20 m/s and rebounds at 15 m/s. Contact time = 0.01s. Find average force.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  Δp = m(v_f - v_i) = 0.05(-15 - 20) = -1.75 kg·m/s
  F_avg = Δp/Δt = 1.75/0.01 = 175 N
  ```

  **Example 2:** Water flows through pipe at 10 m/s, cross-section 0.1 m². Find force on wall (perpendicular impact, ρ = 1000 kg/m³).

  **Solution:**
  ```
  dm/dt = ρAv = 1000 × 0.1 × 10 = 1000 kg/s
  F = v(dm/dt) = 10 × 1000 = 10,000 N = 10 kN
  ```

  ## Common JEE Problems

  ### Type 1: Impulse Calculation
  - Area under F-t graph = Impulse = Δp

  ### Type 2: Variable Force Problems
  - F = F(t) or F = F(x)
  - Integrate to find velocity/displacement

  ### Type 3: Collision Problems
  - Use momentum conservation
  - Calculate impulse during collision

  ### Type 4: Chain/Rope Problems
  - Variable mass consideration
  - F = λv² (λ = mass per unit length)

  ## Key Points for JEE

  1. **F = ma is special case** of F = dp/dt (when m is constant)
  2. **Impulse has same units** as momentum (N·s = kg·m/s)
  3. **During very short collisions**, impulse ≈ constant even if force varies
  4. **Rocket acceleration increases** as fuel burns (mass decreases)
  5. **Force on hose pipe** when water exits = ρAv²

  question: "A 2 kg object moving at 10 m/s is brought to rest in 0.5 s. The average force applied is:"
  options:
  - "10 N"
  - "20 N"
  - "40 N"
  - "100 N"
  correct_answer: "40 N"
  explanation: "Using impulse-momentum theorem: F_avg = Δp/Δt = m(v_f - v_i)/Δt = 2(0 - 10)/0.5 = -20/0.5 = -40 N. The magnitude is 40 N. This demonstrates that force equals rate of change of momentum. The negative sign indicates the force opposes motion (retarding force). In JEE, always consider direction - the force acts opposite to initial velocity to bring object to rest."

  question: "Water flows from a pipe at rate 5 kg/s and strikes a vertical wall normally with velocity 10 m/s. If water does not rebound, the force on wall is:"
  options:
  - "25 N"
  - "50 N"
  - "100 N"
  - "500 N"
  correct_answer: "50 N"
  explanation: "For a jet of water hitting wall without rebounding: F = v × (dm/dt) = 10 × 5 = 50 N. The momentum change per second equals the force. If water rebounds with same speed, force would be 2v(dm/dt) = 100 N. This is because momentum change would be from +mv to -mv, total change 2mv. This type of problem frequently appears in JEE, testing understanding of continuous momentum transfer."

  question: "A rocket expels gas at rate 10 kg/s with exhaust velocity 500 m/s relative to rocket. The thrust on rocket is:"
  options:
  - "50 N"
  - "500 N"
  - "5000 N"
  - "50000 N"
  correct_answer: "5000 N"
  explanation: "Rocket thrust = exhaust velocity × mass flow rate = v_rel × (dm/dt) = 500 × 10 = 5000 N. This comes from Newton's second law for variable mass: F = v_rel(dm/dt). The rocket gains momentum equal to the momentum carried away by exhaust gases. As fuel burns (mass decreases), if thrust remains constant, acceleration increases (a = F/m). This principle drives all rocket propulsion and is a key JEE topic."
