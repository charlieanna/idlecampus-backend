  # Free Body Diagrams: Systematic Problem Solving

  ## What is a Free Body Diagram (FBD)?

  A **Free Body Diagram** is a simplified diagram showing:
  - The object isolated from its surroundings
  - All external forces acting ON the object
  - Direction and approximate magnitude of forces

  ## Why FBDs are Essential

  1. **Visualize all forces** systematically
  2. **Apply Newton's laws** correctly
  3. **Avoid missing forces** or double-counting
  4. **Break complex problems** into manageable parts

  ## Steps to Draw FBD

  ### Step 1: Identify the System
  - Choose the object/system to analyze
  - Isolate it from surroundings

  ### Step 2: List All Forces
  - Weight (always present if mass exists)
  - Normal force (if contact with surface)
  - Tension (if strings/ropes attached)
  - Friction (if relative motion/tendency)
  - Applied forces (push, pull)
  - Spring force, air resistance, etc.

  ### Step 3: Draw Forces
  - Represent object as point or simple shape
  - Draw arrows from object outward
  - Label each force clearly
  - Show direction accurately

  ### Step 4: Choose Coordinate System
  - Usually: x along motion, y perpendicular
  - On incline: x along incline, y normal to it
  - Resolve forces into components

  ## Common Forces in FBDs

  ### 1. Weight (W or mg)
  ```
  W = mg (always downward)
  ```
  - Acts at center of mass
  - Due to Earth's gravity
  - Independent of motion or support

  ### 2. Normal Force (N)
  ```
  N ⊥ to contact surface
  ```
  - Reaction to compression
  - Adjusts to prevent penetration
  - N ≠ mg always (common mistake!)

  ### 3. Tension (T)
  ```
  T = along string, away from object
  ```
  - Pulling force through string/rope
  - Same throughout massless string
  - Can only pull, never push

  ### 4. Friction (f)
  ```
  f = μN (opposes relative motion)
  f_s ≤ μ_s N (static)
  f_k = μ_k N (kinetic)
  ```

  ## Important FBD Cases

  ### Case 1: Object on Horizontal Surface
  ```
  Forces: Weight (mg↓), Normal (N↑)
  If stationary: N = mg
  If vertical acceleration a: N = m(g ± a)
  ```

  ### Case 2: Object on Inclined Plane
  ```
  Along incline: mg sin θ (down)
  Normal to incline: N = mg cos θ
  Friction: f = μN = μmg cos θ
  ```

  ### Case 3: Two Connected Masses (Atwood)
  For mass m₁:
  ```
  T - m₁g = m₁a (if moving up)
  ```
  For mass m₂:
  ```
  m₂g - T = m₂a (if moving down)
  ```

  ### Case 4: Mass on Accelerating Platform
  ```
  In ground frame: N - mg = ma
  In platform frame: N - mg - ma_pseudo = 0
  ```

  ## Common Mistakes in FBDs

  1. ❌ Including reaction forces on SAME body
  2. ❌ Forgetting weight
  3. ❌ Wrong direction of friction
  4. ❌ N = mg always (wrong on inclines or with vertical acceleration)
  5. ❌ Missing normal force at contact
  6. ❌ Including internal forces

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** 10 kg block on table, horizontal force F = 30 N applied. If μ_k = 0.2, find acceleration.

  **FBD:**
  ```
  Forces: F (→), N (↑), mg (↓), f (←)

  Vertical: N = mg = 100 N
  Horizontal: F - f = ma
  30 - μN = 10a
  30 - 20 = 10a
  a = 1 m/s²
  ```

  **Example 2:** Two masses 3 kg and 2 kg connected by string over pulley. Find tension and acceleration.

  **Solution:**
  For 3 kg (heavier, moving down):
  ```
  3g - T = 3a
  30 - T = 3a ... (1)
  ```

  For 2 kg (lighter, moving up):
  ```
  T - 2g = 2a
  T - 20 = 2a ... (2)
  ```

  Adding: 10 = 5a → a = 2 m/s²
  T = 20 + 4 = 24 N

  ## JEE Problem-Solving Tips

  1. **Draw separate FBDs** for each mass
  2. **Choose smart coordinates** (often along motion)
  3. **Write Newton's second law** for each direction
  4. **Count equations and unknowns** - should match
  5. **Check dimensions** of final answer
  6. **Verify limiting cases** (e.g., μ = 0, θ = 0)

  ## Advanced Concepts

  ### Apparent Weight in Lift:
  ```
  W_apparent = N = m(g ± a)

  Lift accelerating up: N = m(g + a) > mg
  Lift accelerating down: N = m(g - a) < mg
  Free fall: N = 0 (weightlessness)
  ```

  ### Multiple Strings/Pulleys:
  - Different tensions if different strings
  - Constraint equations needed
  - T₁ ≠ T₂ if masses of pulleys considered

  question: "A 5 kg block rests on a surface. A 30 N force is applied at 60° above horizontal. The normal force is: (g = 10 m/s²)"
  options:
  - "50 N"
  - "35 N"
  - "65 N"
  - "24 N"
  correct_answer: "24 N"
  explanation: "FBD shows: Weight (50 N down), Applied force (30 N at 60°), Normal force (N up). Vertical component of applied force = 30 sin 60° = 30(√3/2) ≈ 26 N (upward). For vertical equilibrium: N + 30 sin 60° = mg. N = 50 - 26 = 24 N. Wait, let me recalculate: 30 × sin 60° = 30 × 0.866 = 26 N. So N = 50 - 26 = 24 N. The upward component of applied force reduces normal force. This shows N ≠ mg when other vertical forces exist. If force were pushed downward, N would increase above mg."

  question: "In an Atwood machine with masses 4 kg and 6 kg, the tension in string is: (g = 10 m/s²)"
  options:
  - "48 N"
  - "50 N"
  - "40 N"
  - "60 N"
  correct_answer: "48 N"
  explanation: "For 6 kg (moving down): 6g - T = 6a → 60 - T = 6a. For 4 kg (moving up): T - 4g = 4a → T - 40 = 4a. Adding equations: 20 = 10a, so a = 2 m/s². Substituting: T = 40 + 4(2) = 48 N. Alternative formula: T = 2m₁m₂g/(m₁+m₂) = 2(4)(6)(10)/10 = 48 N. Note: T is between weights of two masses (40 N < 48 N < 60 N), which makes physical sense. If masses were equal, T = mg and a = 0."

  question: "A person weighing 600 N stands in a lift. If lift accelerates downward at 2 m/s², the apparent weight is: (g = 10 m/s²)"
  options:
  - "600 N"
  - "480 N"
  - "720 N"
  - "120 N"
  correct_answer: "480 N"
  explanation: "Mass = 600/10 = 60 kg. When lift accelerates downward: N = m(g - a) = 60(10 - 2) = 60 × 8 = 480 N. The apparent weight (normal force from floor) decreases when accelerating downward. Think of it: If acceleration = g (free fall), N = 0 (weightlessness). If lift accelerates upward at 2 m/s², N = 60(10 + 2) = 720 N. This is why you feel heavier when lift starts going up and lighter when it starts going down."
