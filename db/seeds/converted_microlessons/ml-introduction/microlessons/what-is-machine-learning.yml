  \n    Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables\
  \ computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.\n\n    ## Traditional\
  \ Programming vs Machine Learning\n\n    ### Traditional Programming\n    ```\n\
  \    Input + Program → Output\n    Example: Calculate tax = income * tax_rate\n\
  \    ```\n\n    ### Machine Learning\n    ```\n    Input + Output → Program (Model)\n\
  \    Example: Given house features and prices, learn to predict prices\n    ```\n\

  question: 'What is the fundamental difference between traditional programming and machine learning?'
  options:
  - 'Traditional: Input + Program → Output; ML: Input + Output → Program'
  - 'Traditional: Input + Output → Program; ML: Input + Program → Output'
  - Traditional programming uses less data than machine learning
  - Machine learning cannot solve problems that traditional programming can
  correct_answer: 'Traditional: Input + Program → Output; ML: Input + Output → Program'
  explanation: "The fundamental difference is how the 'program' (model) is created. In traditional programming, humans write explicit rules: Input + Program → Output (e.g., tax = income × tax_rate). In machine learning, the system learns the rules from examples: Input + Output → Program/Model (e.g., given house features and prices, the model learns to predict prices). This is why ML excels at problems too complex to program explicitly, like image recognition or speech recognition."

  question: 'In supervised learning, what do you need in your training data?'
  options:
  - Both features (X) and labels (y)
  - Only features (X) without labels
  - Only labels (y) without features
  - Neither features nor labels
  correct_answer: Both features (X) and labels (y)
  explanation: "Supervised learning requires labeled data - both input features (X) and corresponding output labels (y). The algorithm learns the mapping f: X → y from these examples. For instance, in email classification, features are email characteristics (words, sender, etc.) and labels are 'spam' or 'not spam.' This differs from unsupervised learning (features only, no labels) and reinforcement learning (learns from rewards/penalties through interaction). Common supervised algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests."

  question: 'Which scenario indicates overfitting in a machine learning model?'
  options:
  - Training accuracy: 99%, Test accuracy: 60%
  - Training accuracy: 65%, Test accuracy: 63%
  - Training accuracy: 85%, Test accuracy: 83%
  - Training accuracy: 70%, Test accuracy: 75%
  correct_answer: Training accuracy: 99%, Test accuracy: 60%
  explanation: "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well (memorizes rather than generalizes), performing excellently on training data but poorly on new, unseen test data. Training accuracy of 99% vs test accuracy of 60% is a classic overfitting pattern - the huge gap shows the model doesn't generalize. Solutions include: using more training data, reducing model complexity, applying regularization, using cross-validation, and early stopping. In contrast, Training 65%/Test 63% indicates underfitting (model too simple), while Training 85%/Test 83% shows good generalization."
