  # Self-Inductance and Mutual Inductance

  ## Self-Inductance

  **EMF induced in coil due to change in its own current.**

  ```
  Magnetic flux: Φ = LI
  Induced EMF: ε = -L(dI/dt)

  L = self-inductance (Henry, H)
  ```

  ### Properties:
  - Opposes change in current (Lenz's law)
  - Like "electrical inertia"
  - Depends on geometry, not on current

  ## Self-Inductance of Solenoid

  ```
  Solenoid: N turns, length l, area A

  B = μ₀nI = μ₀NI/l
  Φ = NBA = μ₀N²IA/l

  L = Φ/I = μ₀N²A/l = μ₀n²Al

  With core (μᵣ): L = μ₀μᵣN²A/l
  ```

  ### Important:
  - L ∝ N² (doubling turns quadruples L)
  - L ∝ A (larger area, more inductance)
  - L ∝ 1/l (longer solenoid, less inductance)

  ## Energy Stored in Inductor

  ```
  Work done to establish current I:
  W = ∫₀ᴵ LI dI = ½LI²

  Energy: U = ½LI²
  ```

  ### Comparison:
  | Capacitor | Inductor |
  |-----------|----------|
  | U = ½CV² | U = ½LI² |
  | Stores energy in E field | Stores energy in B field |
  | Opposes voltage change | Opposes current change |

  ### Energy Density:
  ```
  u = B²/(2μ₀) (energy per unit volume)

  Total: U = B²V/(2μ₀) = ½LI²
  ```

  ## LR Circuit (Growth of Current)

  ### Circuit: Inductor L with resistance R, connected to EMF ε:
  ```
  ε = IR + L(dI/dt)

  Solution: I(t) = (ε/R)(1 - e^(-t/τ))

  Time constant: τ = L/R
  ```

  ### Behavior:
  - At t = 0: I = 0 (inductor opposes sudden change)
  - At t = τ: I = 0.63(ε/R)
  - At t → ∞: I = ε/R (steady state)

  ## LR Circuit (Decay of Current)

  ```
  I(t) = I₀e^(-t/τ) = I₀e^(-Rt/L)

  At t = τ: I = I₀/e = 0.37I₀
  At t = 5τ: I ≈ 0.007I₀ (effectively zero)
  ```

  ## Mutual Inductance

  **EMF induced in one coil due to change in current in another.**

  ```
  Flux in coil 2 due to I₁: Φ₂₁ = MI₁
  EMF in coil 2: ε₂ = -M(dI₁/dt)

  M = mutual inductance
  ```

  ### Reciprocity:
  ```
  M₁₂ = M₂₁ = M

  Mutual inductance is same either way!
  ```

  ## Coefficient of Coupling

  ```
  M = k√(L₁L₂)

  k = coefficient of coupling (0 ≤ k ≤ 1)
  k = 1: Perfect coupling (all flux links)
  k = 0: No coupling
  ```

  ### For coaxial solenoids:
  ```
  M = μ₀N₁N₂A/l

  Where A is area of inner solenoid
  ```

  ## Mutual Inductance: Two Coils

  ### Coaxial coils of radii R₁ and R₂ (R₁ << R₂):
  ```
  M = μ₀πN₁N₂R₁²/(2R₂)
  ```

  ### Two solenoids (one inside other):
  ```
  M = μ₀N₁N₂A/l

  A = cross-section of inner solenoid
  l = length of outer solenoid
  ```

  ## Combination of Inductors

  ### Series (no mutual inductance):
  ```
  L_eq = L₁ + L₂

  If mutual inductance M:
  L_eq = L₁ + L₂ + 2M (aiding)
  L_eq = L₁ + L₂ - 2M (opposing)
  ```

  ### Parallel:
  ```
  1/L_eq = 1/L₁ + 1/L₂

  L_eq = L₁L₂/(L₁ + L₂)
  ```

  ## Transformer Principle

  Based on mutual inductance:
  ```
  ε₂/ε₁ = N₂/N₁ (voltage ratio)
  I₂/I₁ = N₁/N₂ (current ratio, ideal)

  Power: ε₁I₁ = ε₂I₂ (ideal, no losses)
  ```

  ### Types:
  - Step-up: N₂ > N₁ (increases voltage)
  - Step-down: N₂ < N₁ (decreases voltage)

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Solenoid: 500 turns, length 0.5 m, area 10 cm². Find self-inductance.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  L = μ₀N²A/l = (4π×10⁻⁷)(500)²(10×10⁻⁴)/(0.5)
  L = (4π×10⁻⁷)(2.5×10⁵)(10⁻³)/(0.5)
  L = π×10⁻⁴/0.5 = 2π×10⁻⁴ ≈ 6.3×10⁻⁴ H = 0.63 mH
  ```

  **Example 2:** Inductor of 2 H carries 5 A current. Energy stored?

  **Solution:**
  ```
  U = ½LI² = ½(2)(5)² = ½(2)(25) = 25 J

  Significant energy! Compare: Capacitor 1000 μF at 100 V
  stores only ½(10⁻³)(10⁴) = 5 J.
  ```

  **Example 3:** LR circuit: L = 4 H, R = 2 Ω, ε = 10 V. Find time constant and steady-state current.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  τ = L/R = 4/2 = 2 s
  I_final = ε/R = 10/2 = 5 A

  At t = 2 s: I = 5(1 - e⁻¹) = 5(0.63) = 3.15 A
  At t = 6 s ≈ 3τ: I ≈ 5(0.95) = 4.75 A
  ```

  3. **U = ½LI²** (energy stored)
  4. **τ = L/R** (time constant)
  5. **M = k√(L₁L₂)** (coupling)
  6. **Opposes current change** (Lenz's law)

  question: "Number of turns in solenoid is doubled keeping other factors same. Self-inductance:"
  options:
  - "Doubles"
  - "Halves"
  - "Becomes 4 times"
  - "Remains same"
  correct_answer: "Becomes 4 times"
  explanation: "L = μ₀N²A/l. If N' = 2N: L' = μ₀(2N)²A/l = 4μ₀N²A/l = 4L. Self-inductance quadruples! This is because: (1) more turns means more flux linkage (×N), and (2) each turn contributes to total flux (×N again). Result: L ∝ N². This N² dependence makes coil design critical. Adding few more turns significantly increases inductance. Conversely, to halve inductance, reduce turns by factor √2, not 2. Compare: Capacitor C ∝ A (linear), but inductor L ∝ N² (quadratic). This makes high-inductance coils bulky with many turns."

  question: "In LR circuit, time constant is 2 s. After how many seconds current reaches 63% of maximum?"
  options:
  - "1 s"
  - "2 s"
  - "4 s"
  - "6 s"
  correct_answer: "2 s"
  explanation: "Current growth: I = I₀(1 - e^(-t/τ)). At t = τ: I = I₀(1 - e⁻¹) = I₀(1 - 0.368) = 0.632I₀ ≈ 63%. Given τ = 2 s, so at t = 2 s, current is 63% of maximum. This is definition of time constant! At t = 2τ: 86%, at 3τ: 95%, at 5τ: 99.3% (practically maximum). Time constant τ = L/R tells how quickly circuit responds. Large L (high inertia) or small R means slow response (large τ). For quick response, use small L or large R. Applications: RL circuits are used as filters, in timing circuits, and to smooth current fluctuations."

  question: "Two coils have self-inductances L₁ = 4 mH and L₂ = 9 mH with coupling coefficient k = 0.5. Mutual inductance is:"
  options:
  - "3 mH"
  - "6 mH"
  - "9 mH"
  - "18 mH"
  correct_answer: "3 mH"
  explanation: "M = k√(L₁L₂) = 0.5√(4×9) mH = 0.5√36 mH = 0.5×6 = 3 mH. The coupling coefficient k = 0.5 means 50% of magnetic flux from one coil links with the other. For perfect coupling (k = 1): M = √(4×9) = 6 mH. Maximum possible M = √(L₁L₂). In practice k < 1 due to flux leakage. Iron core transformers have k ≈ 0.95-0.99. Air-core inductors have lower k. This formula is used in transformer design, wireless power transfer, and inductive sensors. Higher k means better energy transfer between coils."
