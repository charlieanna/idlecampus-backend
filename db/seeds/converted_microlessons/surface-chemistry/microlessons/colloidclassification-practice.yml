  Milk is an emulsion where fat droplets (liquid) are dispersed in water (liquid).
  It is a liquid-in-liquid colloidal system.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'Milk is an example of:'
  options:
  - Emulsion (liquid in liquid)
  - Sol (solid in liquid)
  - Foam (gas in liquid)
  - Aerosol (liquid in gas)
  correct_answer: Emulsion (liquid in liquid)
  explanation: "Milk is an emulsion where fat droplets (liquid dispersed phase) are dispersed in water (liquid dispersion medium). It is specifically a liquid-in-liquid colloidal system. Milk also contains casein protein which acts as an emulsifying agent, stabilizing the fat droplets and preventing them from coalescing. This is why milk appears white - the colloidal fat particles scatter light (Tyndall effect)."

  question: 'Fog is classified as which type of colloid?'
  options:
  - Aerosol (liquid in gas)
  - Foam (gas in liquid)
  - Emulsion (liquid in liquid)
  - Sol (solid in liquid)
  correct_answer: Aerosol (liquid in gas)
  explanation: "Fog consists of tiny water droplets (liquid dispersed phase) suspended in air (gas dispersion medium), making it an aerosol. Other examples of liquid-in-gas aerosols include clouds, mist, and insecticide sprays. In contrast, smoke is a solid-in-gas aerosol (solid particles in air), and foam is gas-in-liquid (like whipped cream or soap lather)."

  question: 'Cheese is an example of which colloidal system?'
  options:
  - Gel (liquid in solid)
  - Sol (solid in liquid)
  - Solid sol (solid in solid)
  - Emulsion (liquid in liquid)
  correct_answer: Gel (liquid in solid)
  explanation: "Cheese is a gel - a colloidal system where liquid (whey/water) is the dispersed phase trapped within a solid dispersion medium (protein network). In gels, the solid forms a continuous three-dimensional network that immobilizes the liquid. Other examples include jelly, butter, and curd. This is opposite to a sol, where solid particles are dispersed in liquid."
