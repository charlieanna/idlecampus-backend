  Zeolites have microporous structure with cavities of molecular dimensions, allowing
  only specific molecules to enter and react - this is called shape-selective catalysis.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'Zeolites are used as catalysts due to their property of:'
  options:
  - Shape-selective catalysis
  - Enzyme-like activity
  - Homogeneous catalysis
  - Auto-catalysis
  correct_answer: Shape-selective catalysis
  explanation: "Zeolites have a microporous structure with cavities of molecular dimensions, allowing only specific molecules that fit into these pores to enter and react. This selective catalysis based on molecular size and shape is called shape-selective catalysis. Enzymes work differently (lock-and-key mechanism), homogeneous catalysis involves catalyst in the same phase, and auto-catalysis is when a reaction product catalyzes its own formation - none of these describe zeolite catalysis."

  question: 'Zeolites are used in petroleum refining for:'
  options:
  - Catalytic cracking to convert heavy hydrocarbons to gasoline
  - Increasing viscosity of crude oil
  - Removing water only
  - Coloring the petroleum products
  correct_answer: Catalytic cracking to convert heavy hydrocarbons to gasoline
  explanation: "Zeolites (particularly ZSM-5) are extensively used as catalysts in petroleum refining for catalytic cracking - breaking down large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller, more valuable ones like gasoline. Their shape-selective properties allow them to: (1) Preferentially crack certain molecular structures, (2) Control product distribution, (3) Increase octane number of gasoline. Zeolite catalysts have largely replaced older silica-alumina catalysts due to their higher activity, selectivity, and stability."

  question: 'The chemical formula of a typical zeolite is:'
  options:
  - Hydrated aluminosilicate [(AlO₂)ₓ(SiO₂)y]·nH₂O with metal cations
  - Pure silica SiO₂
  - Metal carbonate
  - Organic polymer
  correct_answer: Hydrated aluminosilicate [(AlO₂)ₓ(SiO₂)y]·nH₂O with metal cations
  explanation: "Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with the general formula Mx/n[(AlO₂)x(SiO₂)y]·nH₂O, where M is a metal cation (Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, etc.) with charge n. The three-dimensional framework has cavities and channels of molecular dimensions. The Al/Si ratio determines acidity and catalytic properties. Water molecules occupy the cavities and can be removed by heating without destroying the framework. Examples: Zeolite-A (Na₁₂[(AlO₂)₁₂(SiO₂)₁₂]·27H₂O), ZSM-5."
