  \ Introduction\n\n    **Catalyst:** A substance that alters the rate of a chemical\
  \ reaction without being consumed in the process.\n\n    **Catalysis:** The phenomenon\
  \ of altering the rate of reaction using a catalyst.\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Types\

  \       ```\n       CH₃COOC₂H₅ + H₂O --[H⁺ or OH⁻]--> CH₃COOH + C₂H₅OH\n       ```\n\
  \n    4. **Inversion of cane sugar:**\n       ```\n       C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ + H₂O --[H⁺]-->\
  \ C₆H₁₂O₆ + C₆H₁₂O₆\n       ```\n\n    ### Heterogeneous Catalysis\n\n    **Definition:**\
  \ Catalyst and reactants are in different phases.\n\n    **Characteristics:**\n\
  \    - Catalyst is usually solid, reactants are gas or liquid\n    - Reaction occurs\
  \ on catalyst surface\n    - Surface area is important\n\n    **Examples:**\n\n\

  \ --[Fe(s)]--> 2NH₃(g)\n       ```\n\n    2. **Ostwald process (Oxidation of ammonia):**\n\
  \       ```\n       4NH₃(g) + 5O₂(g) --[Pt(s)]--> 4NO(g) + 6H₂O(g)\n       ```\n\
  \n    3. **Contact process (SO₃ production):**\n       ```\n       2SO₂(g) + O₂(g)\

  \ Catalysis\n\n    **Steps:**\n\n    1. **Diffusion:** Reactant molecules diffuse\
  \ to catalyst surface\n    2. **Adsorption:** Reactants are adsorbed on catalyst\
  \ surface (chemisorption)\n    3. **Reaction:** Adsorbed molecules react on surface\
  \ (activation energy lowered)\n    4. **Desorption:** Products desorb from surface\n\
  \    5. **Diffusion:** Products diffuse away from surface\n\n    **Active sites:**\

  question: What is the fundamental difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous
    catalysis in terms of phase and reaction mechanism?
  options:
  - Homogeneous catalysis occurs in gas phase only; heterogeneous catalysis occurs
    in liquid phase only
  - Homogeneous catalysis has catalyst and reactants in the same phase with uniform
    distribution; heterogeneous catalysis has different phases with surface reaction
  - Heterogeneous catalysis is faster because it uses solid catalysts
  - Homogeneous catalysis requires higher temperatures than heterogeneous catalysis
  correct_answer: Homogeneous catalysis has catalyst and reactants in the same phase
    with uniform distribution; heterogeneous catalysis has different phases with surface
    reaction
  explanation: 'Homogeneous catalysis occurs when the catalyst and reactants exist
    in the same phase (both gas or both liquid), leading to uniform distribution and
    molecular-level interaction. For example, in esterification (CH₃COOH + C₂H₅OH
    → ester), H₂SO₄ catalyst is liquid like the reactants, mixing uniformly. The reaction
    happens throughout the solution. Heterogeneous catalysis involves different phases
    - typically a solid catalyst with gas or liquid reactants. The reaction occurs
    at the interface, specifically on the catalyst surface. For example, in the Haber
    process (N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃), iron catalyst is solid while gases diffuse to its surface,
    adsorb, react at active sites, then products desorb. The mechanism involves: diffusion
    → adsorption (chemisorption) → surface reaction → desorption → diffusion away.
    Surface area is critical in heterogeneous catalysis (more area = more active sites),
    while concentration matters in homogeneous catalysis. Industrial processes often
    use heterogeneous catalysts because they''re easier to separate and regenerate.'

  question: How does a catalyst increase the rate of reaction without being consumed,
    and what is its effect on the equilibrium position?
  options:
  - Catalyst increases activation energy and shifts equilibrium toward products
  - Catalyst lowers activation energy by providing an alternate pathway, but does
    not change equilibrium position or ΔG
  - Catalyst changes the thermodynamics (ΔG) of the reaction, making it more favorable
  - Catalyst increases only the forward reaction rate, shifting equilibrium to the
    right
  correct_answer: Catalyst lowers activation energy by providing an alternate pathway,
    but does not change equilibrium position or ΔG
  explanation: A catalyst works by providing an alternate reaction pathway with lower
    activation energy (Ea). According to Arrhenius equation (k = Ae^(-Ea/RT)), lowering
    Ea increases the rate constant k, so more molecules have sufficient energy to
    react at a given temperature. Crucially, the catalyst lowers Ea for both the forward
    AND backward reactions equally, so the equilibrium constant K (which depends only
    on ΔG, not Ea) remains unchanged. The catalyst helps the system reach equilibrium
    faster but doesn't shift the equilibrium position. For example, in the reversible
    reaction N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃, Fe catalyst speeds up both ammonia formation and decomposition
    equally. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) is a state function depending only
    on initial and final states - adding a catalyst doesn't change thermodynamics,
    only kinetics. The catalyst participates in intermediate steps, forming temporary
    complexes, but regenerates at the end, so it's not consumed. This is why small
    amounts of catalyst can process large amounts of reactants.

  question: What is the role of promoters and catalytic poisons, and how do they affect
    catalyst activity?
  options:
  - Promoters slow down reactions; poisons speed up reactions
  - Promoters enhance catalyst activity by increasing active sites or preventing deactivation;
    poisons reduce activity by blocking active sites
  - Both promoters and poisons are alternate catalysts that can replace the main catalyst
  - Promoters increase activation energy; poisons decrease activation energy
  correct_answer: Promoters enhance catalyst activity by increasing active sites or
    preventing deactivation; poisons reduce activity by blocking active sites
  explanation: 'Promoters (also called co-catalysts) are substances that enhance catalyst
    activity without being catalysts themselves. In the Haber process (N₂ + 3H₂ →
    2NH₃), iron is the main catalyst, but molybdenum (Mo) acts as a promoter - it
    doesn''t directly catalyze the reaction but improves Fe''s performance by creating
    more active sites or preventing sintering (loss of surface area at high temperatures).
    Promoters may also modify electronic properties of the catalyst surface, making
    adsorption/desorption more favorable. Conversely, catalytic poisons are substances
    that strongly bind to active sites, blocking them and reducing catalyst effectiveness.
    For example: (1) Arsenic poisons Pt catalyst in the Contact process for SO₃ production,
    (2) CO poisons Fe in Haber process by forming strong Fe-CO bonds, (3) Lead poisons
    automotive catalytic converters, which is why unleaded gasoline is required. Poisoning
    can be reversible (weak binding) or irreversible (strong chemisorption). Understanding
    promoters and poisons is crucial for industrial catalyst design and maintaining
    catalyst lifetime in chemical plants.'
