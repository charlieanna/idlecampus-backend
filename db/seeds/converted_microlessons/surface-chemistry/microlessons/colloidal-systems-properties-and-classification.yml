  \ Systems\n\n    ## Introduction\n\n    **Colloidal solution (or sol):** A heterogeneous\
  \ mixture where particle size is intermediate between true solution and suspension.\n\
  \n    **Particle size:**\n    - True solution: < 1 nm\n    - Colloidal solution:\
  \ 1-1000 nm (1-100 nm typically)\n    - Suspension: > 1000 nm\n\n    **Components:**\n\
  \    - **Dispersed phase:** Substance distributed as particles (like solute)\n \
  \   - **Dispersion medium:** Medium in which particles are dispersed (like solvent)\n\
  \n    ---\n\n    ## Classification of Colloids\n\n    ### Based on Physical State\n\
  \n    | Dispersed Phase | Dispersion Medium | Name | Example |\n    |-----------------|-------------------|------|---------|\n\
  \    | Solid | Solid | Solid sol | Colored glasses, gemstones |\n    | Solid | Liquid\
  \ | Sol | Paint, ink, gold sol |\n    | Solid | Gas | Aerosol | Smoke, dust in air\
  \ |\n    | Liquid | Solid | Gel | Jellies, cheese, butter |\n    | Liquid | Liquid\
  \ | Emulsion | Milk, mayonnaise |\n    | Liquid | Gas | Aerosol | Fog, mist, cloud\
  \ |\n    | Gas | Solid | Solid foam | Pumice stone, foam rubber |\n    | Gas | Liquid\
  \ | Foam | Soap foam, whipped cream |\n\n    **Note:** Gas-gas mixtures are always\
  \ homogeneous (true solutions), never colloidal.\n\n    ### Based on Nature of Interaction\n\
  \n    #### 1. Lyophilic Colloids (Solvent-loving)\n    - Strong interaction between\
  \ dispersed phase and medium\n    - Directly formed by mixing with solvent\n   \
  \ - **Reversible:** Can be reconstituted after evaporation\n    - **Stable:** Not\
  \ easily coagulated\n    - **Examples:** Starch, gelatin, rubber, proteins in water\n\
  \n    #### 2. Lyophobic Colloids (Solvent-hating)\n    - Weak or no interaction\
  \ between dispersed phase and medium\n    - Not directly formed, need special methods\n\
  \    - **Irreversible:** Cannot be reconstituted\n    - **Unstable:** Easily coagulated\n\
  \    - **Examples:** Metal sols (gold, silver), sulfur sol, As₂S₃ sol\n\n    **If\
  \ water is the medium:**\n    - Lyophilic → Hydrophilic\n    - Lyophobic → Hydrophobic\n\
  \n    ### Based on Type of Particles\n\n    #### 1. Multimolecular Colloids\n  \
  \  - Large number of atoms/molecules aggregate together\n    - Size in colloidal\
  \ range\n    - **Example:** Gold sol, sulfur sol\n\n    #### 2. Macromolecular Colloids\n\
  \    - Individual large molecules (macromolecules)\n    - Size naturally in colloidal\
  \ range\n    - **Example:** Proteins, starch, cellulose, polymers\n\n    #### 3.\
  \ Associated Colloids (Micelles)\n    - Formed by aggregation of small molecules\
  \ above a certain concentration\n    - **CMC (Critical Micelle Concentration):**\
  \ Minimum concentration for micelle formation\n    - **Kraft Temperature:** Minimum\
  \ temperature for micelle formation\n    - **Example:** Soaps, detergents\n\n  \
  \  ---\n\n    ## Preparation of Colloids\n\n    ### Dispersion Methods (Breaking\
  \ down larger particles)\n\n    #### 1. Mechanical Dispersion\n    - Grinding substance\
  \ with dispersion medium in colloid mill\n    - **Example:** Preparation of colloidal\
  \ solutions of dyes\n\n    #### 2. Electrical Dispersion (Bredig's Arc Method)\n\
  \    - Electric arc struck between metal electrodes under water\n    - Metal vaporizes\
  \ and condenses to colloidal particles\n    - **Example:** Preparation of gold,\
  \ silver, platinum sols\n\n    #### 3. Peptization\n    - Process of converting\
  \ precipitate into colloid by adding electrolyte (peptizing agent)\n    - Electrolyte\
  \ gets preferentially adsorbed\n    - **Example:** Fresh Fe(OH)₃ precipitate + FeCl₃\
  \ → Fe(OH)₃ sol\n\n    ### Condensation Methods (Building up from smaller particles)\n\
  \n    #### 1. Chemical Methods\n\n    **Oxidation:**\n    ```\n    2H₂S + SO₂ →\
  \ 3S (sol) + 2H₂O\n    ```\n\n    **Reduction:**\n    ```\n    2AuCl₃ + 3HCHO +\
  \ 3H₂O → 2Au (sol) + 3HCOOH + 6HCl\n    ```\n\n    **Hydrolysis:**\n    ```\n  \
  \  FeCl₃ + 3H₂O → Fe(OH)₃ (sol) + 3HCl\n    ```\n\n    **Double decomposition:**\n\
  \    ```\n    As₂O₃ + 3H₂S → As₂S₃ (sol) + 3H₂O\n    ```\n\n    #### 2. Change of\
  \ Solvent\n    - Dissolve substance in one solvent\n    - Pour into another solvent\
  \ where it's less soluble\n    - **Example:** Sulfur sol by pouring alcoholic sulfur\
  \ solution into water\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Properties of Colloids\n\n    ### 1.\
  \ Heterogeneous Nature\n    - Colloids are heterogeneous (two phases)\n    - But\
  \ appear homogeneous to naked eye\n\n    ### 2. Filterability\n    - Pass through\
  \ ordinary filter paper\n    - Do not pass through parchment or cellophane (semi-permeable\
  \ membrane)\n    - **Dialysis:** Purification of colloids by removing dissolved\
  \ substances\n\n    ### 3. Colligative Properties\n    - Exhibit colligative properties\n\
  \    - But much smaller than true solutions (fewer particles per unit mass)\n\n\
  \    ### 4. Tyndall Effect\n    - Scattering of light by colloidal particles\n \
  \   - Path of light becomes visible\n    - **Not shown by true solutions** (particles\
  \ too small)\n    - **Example:** Beam of light in a dusty room, car headlights in\
  \ fog\n\n    ### 5. Brownian Motion\n    - Random, zig-zag motion of colloidal particles\n\
  \    - Due to unequal bombardment by molecules of dispersion medium\n    - Prevents\
  \ settling of particles under gravity\n    - Observed under ultramicroscope\n\n\
  \    ### 6. Charge on Colloidal Particles\n    - All particles in a given colloid\
  \ have same charge\n    - Prevents aggregation (repulsion)\n    - **Positive sols:**\
  \ Fe(OH)₃, Al(OH)₃, metal sols\n    - **Negative sols:** As₂S₃, sulfur sol, gold\
  \ sol, starch, gums\n\n    ### 7. Electrophoresis\n    - Movement of colloidal particles\
  \ under electric field\n    - Positive particles move to cathode (negative electrode)\n\
  \    - Negative particles move to anode (positive electrode)\n    - **Applications:**\
  \ Determination of charge, purification\n\n    ### 8. Coagulation or Flocculation\n\
  \    - Settling down of colloidal particles\n    - Achieved by:\n      - **Adding\
  \ electrolytes** (most effective)\n      - Heating\n      - Mixing oppositely charged\
  \ sols\n    - **Hardy-Schulze Rule:** Greater the valence of coagulating ion, greater\
  \ its coagulating power\n    - For negative sols: Al³⁺ > Ba²⁺ > Na⁺\n    - For positive\
  \ sols: [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ > PO₄³⁻ > SO₄²⁻ > Cl⁻\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Protection of Colloids\n\
  \n    **Protective Colloids:** Lyophilic colloids added to lyophobic sols to prevent\
  \ coagulation\n\n    **Example:** Gelatin added to gold sol\n\n    **Gold Number:**\
  \ Minimum mass (in mg) of protective colloid required to prevent coagulation of\
  \ 10 mL of gold sol by 1 mL of 10% NaCl solution\n\n    - **Lower gold number =\
  \ Better protective action**\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Applications of Colloids\n\n \
  \   1. **Purification of water:** Alum coagulates suspended impurities\n    2. **Medicines:**\
  \ Colloidal silver (Argyrol) as antiseptic\n    3. **Smoke precipitation:** Cottrell\
  \ precipitator\n    4. **Artificial rain:** Cloud seeding with AgI\n    5. **Photography:**\
  \ Silver bromide in gelatin\n    6. **Food industry:** Ice cream, whipped cream\n\
  \    7. **Rubber industry:** Latex is colloidal\n    8. **Cleansing action of soaps**\n\
  \n    ---\n\n    ## IIT JEE Key Points\n\n    1. Colloidal particle size: **1-1000\
  \ nm** (typically 1-100 nm)\n    2. **Tyndall effect:** Scattering of light by colloidal\
  \ particles\n    3. **Brownian motion:** Random motion preventing settling\n   \
  \ 4. **Electrophoresis:** Movement under electric field\n    5. **Hardy-Schulze\
  \ rule:** Higher charge → Greater coagulating power\n    6. **Lyophilic:** Reversible,\
  \ stable; **Lyophobic:** Irreversible, unstable\n    7. **Peptization:** Precipitate\
  \ → Colloid (with electrolyte)\n    8. **Gold number:** Lower value = Better protection\n\
  \    9. Gas-gas mixtures are **never colloidal**\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Colloids\n\
