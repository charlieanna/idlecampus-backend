  \  ## Introduction\n\n    **Adsorption** is the phenomenon of accumulation of molecules\
  \ of a substance on the surface of a solid or liquid, forming a molecular or atomic\
  \ film.\n\n    - **Adsorbate:** The substance that gets adsorbed\n    - **Adsorbent:**\
  \ The surface on which adsorption occurs\n\n    **Examples:**\n    - Activated charcoal\
  \ adsorbs gases\n    - Silica gel adsorbs moisture\n    - Animal charcoal decolorizes\
  \ sugar solutions\n\n    ## Adsorption vs Absorption\n\n    | Adsorption | Absorption\

  \ Affecting Adsorption\n\n    ### 1. Nature of Adsorbent\n    - **Surface area:**\
  \ Greater surface area → More adsorption\n    - **Porosity:** Porous materials have\
  \ higher adsorption capacity\n    - **Activation:** Activated charcoal has very\
  \ high surface area\n\n    ### 2. Nature of Adsorbate\n    - **Easily liquefiable\
  \ gases** (high critical temperature) are easily adsorbed\n    - Order: NH₃ > SO₂\
  \ > HCl > CO₂ > CH₄ > H₂ > N₂\n    - Polar molecules are preferentially adsorbed\
  \ over non-polar\n\n    ### 3. Temperature\n    - **Physisorption:** Decreases with\
  \ increasing temperature (exothermic)\n    - **Chemisorption:** Initially increases,\
  \ then decreases\n\n    ### 4. Pressure\n    - **Increases with pressure** at constant\
  \ temperature\n    - At high pressure, adsorption becomes independent of pressure\
  \ (saturation)\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Adsorption Isotherms\n\n    Adsorption isotherms\
  \ are graphs showing the variation of adsorption with pressure at constant temperature.\n\
  \n    ### 1. Freundlich Adsorption Isotherm\n\n    **Equation:**\n    ```\n    x/m\
  \ = k·P^(1/n)\n    ```\n\n    Where:\n    - x = mass of gas adsorbed\n    - m =\
  \ mass of adsorbent\n    - P = pressure\n    - k, n = constants (depend on nature\
  \ of adsorbate and adsorbent)\n    - n > 1\n\n    **Logarithmic form:**\n    ```\n\
  \    log(x/m) = log k + (1/n)log P\n    ```\n\n    This is a straight line with:\n\
  \    - Slope = 1/n\n    - Intercept = log k\n\n    **Validity:**\n    - Valid for\
  \ moderate pressure range\n    - Fails at very low and very high pressures\n\n \
  \   ### 2. Langmuir Adsorption Isotherm\n\n    **Assumptions:**\n    - Adsorption\
  \ occurs on specific sites on the adsorbent surface\n    - Each site can hold only\
  \ one molecule (monolayer)\n    - All sites are equivalent\n    - No interaction\
  \ between adsorbed molecules\n\n    **Equation:**\n    ```\n    x/m = (a·b·P)/(1\
  \ + b·P)\n    ```\n\n    Where:\n    - a = maximum adsorption capacity\n    - b\
  \ = constant related to enthalpy of adsorption\n\n    **At low pressure:** x/m =\
  \ a·b·P (linear)\n    **At high pressure:** x/m = a (constant, saturation)\n\n \
  \   ---\n\n    ## Applications of Adsorption\n\n    1. **Gas masks:** Activated\

  question: What are the fundamental differences between physisorption and chemisorption
    in terms of forces, reversibility, and layer formation?
  options:
  - Physisorption uses chemical bonds and forms monolayers; chemisorption uses van
    der Waals forces and forms multilayers
  - Physisorption uses weak van der Waals forces, is reversible, and can form multilayers;
    chemisorption uses strong chemical bonds, is irreversible, and forms only monolayers
  - Both are identical except chemisorption requires higher pressure
  - Physisorption occurs only with gases; chemisorption occurs only with liquids
  correct_answer: Physisorption uses weak van der Waals forces, is reversible, and
    can form multilayers; chemisorption uses strong chemical bonds, is irreversible,
    and forms only monolayers
  explanation: 'Physisorption (physical adsorption) and chemisorption (chemical adsorption)
    differ fundamentally in their mechanisms. Physisorption involves weak van der
    Waals forces - the same intermolecular forces responsible for liquefaction of
    gases. Heat of adsorption is low (20-40 kJ/mol, similar to condensation enthalpies),
    no activation energy is required, and the process is easily reversible by increasing
    temperature or decreasing pressure. Since bonding is weak and non-specific, multiple
    layers can form on the surface (multilayer adsorption). Example: nitrogen gas
    (N₂) adsorbed on iron at low temperature - the N₂ molecules remain intact. Chemisorption
    involves actual chemical bond formation (covalent or ionic bonds) between adsorbate
    and adsorbent. Heat of adsorption is high (80-400 kJ/mol, comparable to chemical
    reactions), activation energy is required, and the process is essentially irreversible
    - you''ve formed new chemical species. Only a monolayer forms because once surface
    sites are occupied with chemical bonds, no more bonding can occur. Example: H₂
    adsorbed on nickel catalyst - H-H bonds break and Ni-H bonds form. Chemisorption
    is crucial in heterogeneous catalysis where bond breaking/forming on catalyst
    surfaces speeds reactions.'

  question: Why are gases with high critical temperatures (like NH₃, SO₂) more easily
    adsorbed than gases with low critical temperatures (like H₂, N₂)?
  options:
  - High critical temperature gases are heavier molecules
  - High critical temperature gases are easily liquefiable and have stronger intermolecular
    forces, making them adsorb more readily
  - Low critical temperature gases are inert and don't react with surfaces
  - High critical temperature gases require less pressure for adsorption
  correct_answer: High critical temperature gases are easily liquefiable and have
    stronger intermolecular forces, making them adsorb more readily
  explanation: 'The relationship between critical temperature and adsorption is rooted
    in intermolecular forces. Critical temperature is the temperature above which
    a gas cannot be liquefied regardless of pressure - it reflects the strength of
    intermolecular forces. Gases with high critical temperatures (NH₃: 405K, SO₂:
    430K, HCl: 324K) have strong intermolecular forces (often due to polarity, hydrogen
    bonding, or high molecular weight), making them easily liquefiable. These same
    strong intermolecular forces make them readily adsorb on surfaces through physisorption
    - the molecules are already "wanting" to stick together, so they also stick to
    adsorbent surfaces. Conversely, gases with low critical temperatures (H₂: 33K,
    N₂: 126K, CH₄: 191K) have weak intermolecular forces (small, non-polar molecules),
    making them hard to liquefy and hard to adsorb. The typical adsorption order is:
    NH₃ > SO₂ > HCl > CO₂ > CH₄ > H₂ > N₂ (decreasing critical temperature). This
    principle is practical: activated charcoal gas masks effectively adsorb toxic
    gases like SO₂ or Cl₂ (high Tc) but are poor at adsorbing light gases like He
    or H₂ (low Tc). Additionally, polar molecules are preferentially adsorbed over
    non-polar molecules on polar adsorbents.'

  question: What does the Freundlich adsorption isotherm equation x/m = k·P^(1/n)
    tell us, and why does it fail at very low and very high pressures?
  options:
  - It shows linear relationship between adsorption and pressure; it always works
    perfectly
  - It shows adsorption increases with pressure (non-linearly); it fails at extremes
    because at low P it predicts zero adsorption and at high P it doesn't account
    for saturation
  - It only applies to chemisorption, not physisorption
  - It predicts that adsorption decreases with pressure
  correct_answer: It shows adsorption increases with pressure (non-linearly); it fails
    at extremes because at low P it predicts zero adsorption and at high P it doesn't
    account for saturation
  explanation: 'The Freundlich isotherm (x/m = k·P^(1/n), where x/m is amount adsorbed
    per gram of adsorbent, P is pressure, k and n are constants with n > 1) is an
    empirical equation describing adsorption. The exponent 1/n (typically 0.1 to 0.5)
    means adsorption increases with pressure, but not linearly - it increases rapidly
    at first, then slows. Taking logarithms gives log(x/m) = log k + (1/n)log P, a
    straight line with slope 1/n and intercept log k, allowing experimental determination
    of k and n. The equation works well at moderate pressures but fails at extremes.
    At very low pressure (P → 0): Since P^(1/n) approaches zero, the equation predicts
    x/m → 0, but in reality, some adsorption occurs even at very low pressures (initial
    rapid adsorption). At very high pressure (P → ∞): The equation predicts x/m keeps
    increasing indefinitely, but physically, the surface has finite sites and reaches
    saturation - adsorption plateaus. This is where the Langmuir isotherm is superior:
    it accounts for monolayer saturation with equation x/m = (a·b·P)/(1 + b·P), which
    correctly predicts x/m → a (constant) at high pressure. Freundlich is useful for
    quick analysis in the moderate pressure range common in industrial applications.'
