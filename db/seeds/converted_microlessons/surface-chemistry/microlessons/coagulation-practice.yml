  According to Hardy-Schulze rule, higher the valence of coagulating ion, greater
  its coagulating power. For negative sol: Al³⁺ (3+) > Ba²⁺ (2+) > Na⁺ (1+).


  ## Key Points

  question: 'For coagulation of a negative sol, arrange the following in order of increasing coagulating power: Na⁺, Ba²⁺, Al³⁺'
  options:
  - Na⁺ < Ba²⁺ < Al³⁺
  - Al³⁺ < Ba²⁺ < Na⁺
  - Ba²⁺ < Na⁺ < Al³⁺
  - Na⁺ < Al³⁺ < Ba²⁺
  correct_answer: Na⁺ < Ba²⁺ < Al³⁺
  explanation: "According to the Hardy-Schulze rule, the coagulating power of an ion is directly proportional to its valence (charge). For a negatively charged sol, the coagulating power of cations increases with charge: univalent (Na⁺, 1+) < divalent (Ba²⁺, 2+) < trivalent (Al³⁺, 3+). This is because higher charged ions more effectively neutralize the charge on colloidal particles. The coagulation value (minimum concentration needed) is inversely proportional to coagulating power."

  question: 'Coagulation can be achieved by:'
  options:
  - Adding electrolytes
  - Heating
  - Both adding electrolytes and heating
  - Diluting the sol
  correct_answer: Both adding electrolytes and heating
  explanation: "Coagulation (precipitation of colloidal particles) can be achieved by multiple methods: (1) Adding electrolytes - ions neutralize the charge on colloidal particles, reducing repulsion, (2) Heating - increases kinetic energy, causing particles to collide and aggregate, (3) Electrophoresis - applying electric field causes particles to move and discharge at electrodes, (4) Mixing oppositely charged sols. Diluting actually stabilizes the sol rather than causing coagulation."

  question: 'The minimum concentration of electrolyte required to cause coagulation is called:'
  options:
  - Coagulation value or flocculation value
  - Critical micelle concentration
  - Gold number
  - Zeta potential
  correct_answer: Coagulation value or flocculation value
  explanation: "The coagulation value (or flocculation value) is the minimum concentration of an electrolyte (in millimoles per liter) required to cause coagulation of a sol. Lower coagulation value indicates higher coagulating power. For example, for As₂S₃ sol (negative), Al³⁺ has much lower coagulation value than Na⁺, making it a more effective coagulating agent. CMC relates to micelles, gold number to protective colloids, and zeta potential to surface charge."
