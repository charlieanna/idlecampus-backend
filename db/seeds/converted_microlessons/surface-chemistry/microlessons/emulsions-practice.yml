  Conductivity test: O/W emulsions conduct electricity because water (dispersion medium)
  conducts. W/O emulsions do not conduct because oil (dispersion medium) is non-conducting.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which test can distinguish between O/W and W/O emulsions?
  options:
  - Conductivity test
  - pH test
  - Density test
  - Viscosity test
  correct_answer: Conductivity test
  explanation: "The conductivity test is used to distinguish between oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions. O/W emulsions conduct electricity because water (the continuous dispersion medium) is a good conductor of electricity. W/O emulsions do not conduct electricity because oil (the continuous dispersion medium) is non-conducting. Examples: Milk is O/W (conducts), while butter is W/O (doesn't conduct). Other tests include dilution test and dye test."

  question: 'Which substance can act as an emulsifying agent?'
  options:
  - Soap
  - Pure water
  - Pure oil
  - Salt
  correct_answer: Soap
  explanation: "Emulsifying agents (or emulsifiers) are substances that stabilize emulsions by reducing interfacial tension between the two immiscible liquids. Soap is an excellent emulsifying agent because it has both hydrophilic (COO⁻ head) and hydrophobic (alkyl tail) parts. The hydrophobic tail dissolves in oil droplets while the hydrophilic head remains in water, forming a protective layer around droplets and preventing coalescence. Other emulsifiers include proteins (casein in milk), gums, and detergents."

  question: 'Emulsions can be broken (demulsified) by:'
  options:
  - Heating, freezing, or adding electrolytes
  - Dilution only
  - Adding more emulsifying agent
  - Stirring vigorously
  correct_answer: Heating, freezing, or adding electrolytes
  explanation: "Emulsions can be broken (separated into constituent liquids) by several methods: (1) Heating - increases kinetic energy and destroys the emulsifying agent film, (2) Freezing - solidifies one phase causing separation, (3) Adding electrolytes - neutralizes charges and destroys stability, (4) Centrifugation - separates phases by density difference, (5) Adding demulsifiers - chemicals that destabilize the emulsion. Adding more emulsifier or stirring would stabilize rather than break the emulsion."
