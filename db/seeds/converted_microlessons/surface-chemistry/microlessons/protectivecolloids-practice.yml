  Gold number is the minimum mass (in mg) of protective colloid needed to prevent
  coagulation. Lower gold number means better protection. A (0.01) < B (0.1), so A
  is better.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: If protective colloid A has gold number 0.01 and B has gold number 0.1,
    which statement is correct?
  options:
  - A is better protective colloid than B
  - B is better protective colloid than A
  - Both have equal protective action
  - Cannot determine from given information
  correct_answer: A is better protective colloid than B
  explanation: "Gold number is the minimum mass (in mg) of a protective colloid needed to prevent coagulation of 10 ml of a standard gold sol when 1 ml of 10% NaCl is added. A lower gold number means less colloid is needed for protection, indicating better protective power. Since A has a gold number of 0.01 (smaller than B's 0.1), A is the better protective colloid - it provides the same protection using less material."

  question: 'Protective colloids function by:'
  options:
  - Forming a protective layer around lyophobic colloid particles
  - Removing all electrolytes from solution
  - Increasing particle size
  - Decreasing temperature
  correct_answer: Forming a protective layer around lyophobic colloid particles
  explanation: "Protective colloids are lyophilic colloids that protect lyophobic colloids from coagulation by electrolytes. They work by adsorbing onto the surface of lyophobic colloidal particles, forming a protective layer. This layer prevents direct contact between particles and shields them from the coagulating effect of electrolytes. Examples: Gelatin protects gold sol, albumin protects silver sol, casein (in milk) protects fat droplets. The protective colloid's hydrophilic groups face outward, stabilizing the system."

  question: 'Which substance can act as a protective colloid?'
  options:
  - Gelatin
  - Sodium chloride
  - Gold sol
  - Distilled water
  correct_answer: Gelatin
  explanation: "Gelatin, starch, gum arabic, and albumin are common protective colloids. These are lyophilic colloids (with strong affinity for the dispersion medium) that can protect lyophobic colloids from coagulation. They have high molecular weight, form viscous solutions, and have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. Gelatin has the lowest gold number (0.005-0.01), making it one of the most effective protective colloids. Sodium chloride is an electrolyte that causes coagulation, not protection."
