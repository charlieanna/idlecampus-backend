  Tyndall effect (scattering of light) is observed only in colloidal solutions. True
  solutions have particles too small to scatter light.


  ## Key Points

  question: 'Tyndall effect is observed in:'
  options:
  - Colloidal solutions only
  - True solutions only
  - Both colloidal and true solutions
  - Neither colloidal nor true solutions
  correct_answer: Colloidal solutions only
  explanation: "The Tyndall effect - the scattering of light by colloidal particles making a visible beam path - is observed only in colloidal solutions. True solutions have particles too small (< 1 nm) to scatter light effectively, so the light beam remains invisible as it passes through. Colloidal particles (1-1000 nm) are large enough to scatter light, making this effect a characteristic property used to distinguish colloids from true solutions."

  question: 'Brownian motion in colloids is caused by:'
  options:
  - Collision with molecules of dispersion medium
  - Gravitational forces
  - Magnetic fields
  - Chemical reactions
  correct_answer: Collision with molecules of dispersion medium
  explanation: "Brownian motion is the random, zig-zag movement of colloidal particles observed under an ultramicroscope. It is caused by unequal bombardment of colloidal particles by the fast-moving molecules of the dispersion medium from different directions. This continuous random motion prevents colloidal particles from settling under gravity, contributing to the stability of the colloid. The effect was discovered by Robert Brown in 1827 and explained by Einstein in 1905."

  question: 'Electrophoresis demonstrates that colloidal particles:'
  options:
  - Carry electric charge
  - Are neutral
  - Are magnetic
  - Have zero mass
  correct_answer: Carry electric charge
  explanation: "Electrophoresis is the movement of colloidal particles under the influence of an electric field toward an oppositely charged electrode. This demonstrates that colloidal particles carry electric charge. Positively charged colloids (like Fe(OH)₃, Al(OH)₃) migrate to the cathode, while negatively charged colloids (like As₂S₃, metals) migrate to the anode. The charge arises from preferential adsorption of ions or ionization of surface groups. This charge is responsible for the stability of colloids."
