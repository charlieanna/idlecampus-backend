  Detergents (sulfonic acid salts) do not form insoluble precipitates with Ca²⁺ and
  Mg²⁺ ions in hard water, unlike soaps which form scum.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Why do detergents work better than soaps in hard water?
  options:
  - They do not form insoluble salts with Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺
  - They have stronger cleansing action in soft water only
  - They do not form micelles
  - They have shorter hydrocarbon chains
  correct_answer: They do not form insoluble salts with Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺
  explanation: "Detergents (sulfonic acid salts) do not form insoluble precipitates with calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺) ions present in hard water, unlike soaps which form scum (insoluble calcium/magnesium salts) and lose effectiveness. Detergents still form micelles (which is how they clean), and the chain length doesn't affect hard water performance. Their advantage is specifically in hard water, not just soft water."

  question: 'The functional group in a typical anionic detergent is:'
  options:
  - Sulfonate group (-SO₃⁻Na⁺)
  - Carboxylate group (-COO⁻Na⁺)
  - Quaternary ammonium group
  - Hydroxyl group
  correct_answer: Sulfonate group (-SO₃⁻Na⁺)
  explanation: "Anionic detergents contain a sulfonate (-SO₃⁻Na⁺) or sulfate (-OSO₃⁻Na⁺) head group. Example: Sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (C₁₂H₂₅-C₆H₄-SO₃⁻Na⁺) is the most common detergent. The sulfonate salts are strong electrolytes that don't form insoluble calcium/magnesium salts in hard water. Carboxylate (-COO⁻) is found in soaps, not detergents. Cationic detergents have quaternary ammonium groups and are used as antiseptics and fabric softeners."

  question: 'Biodegradable detergents have:'
  options:
  - Straight chain hydrocarbons that can be broken down by bacteria
  - Highly branched chains resistant to bacteria
  - No hydrocarbon chains
  - Aromatic rings only
  correct_answer: Straight chain hydrocarbons that can be broken down by bacteria
  explanation: "Biodegradable detergents have straight (unbranched) hydrocarbon chains that can be broken down by bacteria in sewage treatment and the environment. Early detergents had highly branched chains (like ABS - alkyl benzene sulfonate with branched chains) that persisted in water, causing foam pollution. Modern detergents use LAS (linear alkyl benzene sulfonate) with straight chains that are readily biodegradable. This environmental consideration is crucial for water quality."
