  # Ohm's Law and Electrical Resistance

  ## Ohm's Law

  **Statement:** Current through conductor is directly proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to resistance.

  ```
  V = IR

  V = Voltage (Volts)
  I = Current (Amperes)
  R = Resistance (Ohms, Ω)
  ```

  ## Electrical Resistance

  **Opposition to flow of current.**

  ```
  R = V/I

  Unit: Ohm (Ω) = V/A
  ```

  ### Factors Affecting Resistance:
  ```
  R = ρL/A

  ρ = resistivity (material property)
  L = length
  A = cross-sectional area
  ```

  **Resistance ∝ Length, ∝ 1/Area**

  ## Resistivity (ρ)

  **Material property** independent of dimensions.

  ```
  ρ = RA/L

  Unit: Ω·m
  ```

  ### Typical Values:
  | Material | ρ (Ω·m) |
  |----------|---------|
  | Silver | 1.6×10⁻⁸ |
  | Copper | 1.7×10⁻⁸ |
  | Aluminum | 2.8×10⁻⁸ |
  | Nichrome | 1.0×10⁻⁶ |
  | Silicon | ~1 |
  | Glass | 10¹⁰-10¹⁴ |

  ## Conductivity (σ)

  **Reciprocal of resistivity:**
  ```
  σ = 1/ρ

  Unit: S/m (Siemens per meter) or (Ω·m)⁻¹
  ```

  Higher conductivity = Better conductor

  ## Conductance (G)

  **Reciprocal of resistance:**
  ```
  G = 1/R = σA/L

  Unit: Siemens (S) or mho (℧)
  ```

  ## Temperature Dependence

  ### For Metals:
  ```
  R = R₀(1 + αΔT)
  ρ = ρ₀(1 + αΔT)

  α = temperature coefficient of resistance
  ```

  - **Metals: α > 0** (R increases with T)
  - **Semiconductors: α < 0** (R decreases with T)
  - **Alloys (Nichrome): α ≈ 0** (used in heating elements)

  ### Typical α Values (per °C):
  - Copper: 0.0039
  - Aluminum: 0.0043
  - Tungsten: 0.0045
  - Carbon: -0.0005
  - Nichrome: 0.0004

  ## Microscopic View

  ```
  ρ = m/(ne²τ)

  n = number density of electrons
  τ = relaxation time
  m = electron mass
  e = electron charge
  ```

  In metals: τ decreases with T → R increases

  ## Series and Parallel Resistors

  ### Series:
  ```
  R_eq = R₁ + R₂ + R₃ + ...

  Same current, voltage divides
  ```

  ### Parallel:
  ```
  1/R_eq = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃ + ...

  Same voltage, current divides
  ```

  ## Resistors Stretching/Compressing

  If wire is stretched to n times length:
  ```
  New length: L' = nL
  New area: A' = A/n (volume constant)
  New resistance: R' = ρ(nL)/(A/n) = n²R
  ```

  **Resistance increases as square of length ratio!**

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Wire of resistance 10Ω is stretched to double its length. Find new resistance.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  R' = n²R = 2² × 10 = 40Ω

  Resistance quadruples!
  ```

  **Example 2:** Copper wire (ρ = 1.7×10⁻⁸ Ω·m) of length 2m and diameter 1mm. Find resistance.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  A = πr² = π(0.5×10⁻³)² = 7.85×10⁻⁷ m²
  R = ρL/A = (1.7×10⁻⁸ × 2)/(7.85×10⁻⁷)
  R ≈ 0.043Ω
  ```

  **Example 3:** Resistance is 100Ω at 20°C. Find at 100°C (α = 0.004/°C).

  **Solution:**
  ```
  R = R₀(1 + αΔT) = 100(1 + 0.004×80)
  R = 100(1.32) = 132Ω

  32% increase in resistance
  ```

  ## JEE Key Points

  1. **V = IR** (fundamental relation)
  2. **R = ρL/A** (geometry dependence)
  3. **R ∝ L²** when wire is stretched
  4. **Metals: R increases with T**
  5. **Semiconductors: R decreases with T**
  6. **Nichrome** used in heaters (low α)
  7. **Superconductors: R = 0** below critical T

  question: "A wire of resistance R is cut into 4 equal parts and connected in parallel. Equivalent resistance is:"
  options:
  - "R/4"
  - "R/16"
  - "4R"
  - "R"
  correct_answer: "R/16"
  explanation: "Each part has resistance R/4 (resistance ∝ length). Four resistors of R/4 in parallel: 1/R_eq = 4/(R/4) = 16/R. So R_eq = R/16. The resistance decreases by factor of 16! This is because: (1) cutting into 4 parts gives R/4 each, (2) parallel combination further reduces by factor of 4. Net effect: 4 × 4 = 16. This technique is used to make low resistance shunts from high resistance wire."

  question: "Temperature coefficient of resistance is negative for:"
  options:
  - "Copper"
  - "Silver"
  - "Germanium"
  - "Tungsten"
  correct_answer: "Germanium"
  explanation: "Germanium is a semiconductor with α < 0, meaning resistance decreases as temperature increases. In semiconductors, higher temperature increases charge carriers (thermal excitation of electrons to conduction band), which dominates over reduced mobility. Metals (Cu, Ag, W) have α > 0 - more thermal vibrations scatter electrons more, increasing resistance. This property is used in thermistors for temperature sensing. NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors use semiconductors."

  question: "A wire is stretched to 3 times its original length. Its resistance becomes:"
  options:
  - "3 times"
  - "9 times"
  - "1/3 times"
  - "1/9 times"
  correct_answer: "9 times"
  explanation: "When stretched 3 times: L' = 3L. Volume remains constant: AL = A'L', so A' = A/3. New resistance: R' = ρL'/A' = ρ(3L)/(A/3) = 9ρL/A = 9R. Resistance increases as square of stretch ratio! This is why overhead power lines (which can stretch slightly) must be made of materials with relatively constant resistance. The n² factor comes from both increased length (×n) and decreased area (×1/n) effects combining."
