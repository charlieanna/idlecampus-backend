  question: "What are the five principles of Panchsheel that form the foundation of India's foreign policy?"
  options:
  - "Democracy, equality, justice, peace, cooperation"
  - "Mutual respect for territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference, equality and mutual benefit, peaceful coexistence"
  - "Sovereignty, secularism, socialism, democracy, unity"
  - "Peace, prosperity, partnership, progress, protection"
  correct_answer: "Mutual respect for territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference, equality and mutual benefit, peaceful coexistence"
  explanation: "Panchsheel, meaning 'Five Principles,' forms the cornerstone of India's foreign policy and was originally agreed upon between India and China in 1954 during negotiations over Tibet. The five principles are: (1) Mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, recognizing the inviolability of national borders; (2) Non-aggression, committing to not attack each other; (3) Non-interference in each other's internal affairs, respecting domestic sovereignty; (4) Equality and mutual benefit in relations, ensuring fair treatment; and (5) Peaceful coexistence, promoting dialogue over conflict. These principles were championed by India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, as a framework for relations between nations with different political and economic systems during the Cold War era. Panchsheel reflects India's commitment to peace, sovereignty, and diplomatic engagement rather than military confrontation. The principles have been incorporated into various international agreements and have influenced the Non-Aligned Movement, which India co-founded. While the India-China relationship has faced challenges, including border conflicts, Panchsheel continues to guide India's bilateral relations with many countries and remains relevant in contemporary international diplomacy as a model for peaceful coexistence."

  question: "Which four countries are members of the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue), and what is its primary focus?"
  options:
  - "India, China, Japan, Australia; economic cooperation"
  - "India, USA, Japan, Australia; Indo-Pacific security and cooperation"
  - "India, Russia, USA, UK; counter-terrorism"
  - "India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka; regional stability"
  correct_answer: "India, USA, Japan, Australia; Indo-Pacific security and cooperation"
  explanation: "The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, commonly known as the Quad, comprises four democratic nations: India, the United States, Japan, and Australia. Initially formed in 2007 following cooperation during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami relief efforts, the Quad lapsed but was revived in 2017 amid growing concerns about China's assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. The primary focus of the Quad is to promote a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region based on democratic values, rule of law, and respect for sovereignty. The grouping coordinates on various issues including maritime security, freedom of navigation, countering terrorism, cybersecurity, and ensuring supply chain resilience. Beyond security, the Quad has expanded cooperation into areas like vaccine diplomacy (Quad Vaccine Partnership during COVID-19), climate change mitigation, critical and emerging technologies, infrastructure development, and disaster relief. The first leaders' summit was held virtually in 2021, followed by in-person meetings, elevating the Quad's significance. While not a formal military alliance, the Quad conducts joint naval exercises (Malabar exercises) and strategic consultations. For India, the Quad represents an important platform for advancing its Act East policy and ensuring strategic autonomy while addressing common challenges in the Indo-Pacific region."

  question: "What is India's 'Neighborhood First' policy, and which two regional organizations are key platforms for this approach?"
  options:
  - "Prioritizing European relations; EU and NATO"
  - "Prioritizing South Asian neighbors; SAARC and BIMSTEC"
  - "Prioritizing Southeast Asia; ASEAN and APEC"
  - "Prioritizing immediate neighbors; G20 and BRICS"
  correct_answer: "Prioritizing South Asian neighbors; SAARC and BIMSTEC"
  explanation: "India's 'Neighborhood First' policy is a key pillar of its foreign policy that prioritizes building strong, mutually beneficial relationships with immediate South Asian neighbors, recognizing that regional stability and prosperity are essential for India's own development and security. This policy emphasizes peaceful coexistence, economic integration, connectivity, and cultural exchanges with countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Afghanistan, and the Maldives. The two main regional organizations serving this policy are SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) with eight members, and BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) with seven members. SAARC, established in 1985, was the original platform for regional cooperation, but has faced challenges due to India-Pakistan tensions, limiting its effectiveness. Consequently, India has increasingly focused on BIMSTEC as an alternative regional forum that excludes Pakistan but includes Thailand and Myanmar, enabling more productive cooperation in trade, connectivity, counter-terrorism, energy, and people-to-people contacts. Under the Neighborhood First policy, India has launched various initiatives including development assistance projects, humanitarian aid during disasters, connectivity projects like roads and power transmission, and cultural exchanges. This approach aims to establish India as a responsible regional power and net security provider in South Asia."
