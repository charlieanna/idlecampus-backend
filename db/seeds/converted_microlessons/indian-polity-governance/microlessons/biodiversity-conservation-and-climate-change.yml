  question: "How many biodiversity hotspots does India have, and what are the two main criteria defined by Norman Myers for identifying them?"
  options:
  - "2 hotspots; 1,000 endemic plants and 50% habitat loss"
  - "4 hotspots; 1,500 endemic plants and 70% habitat loss"
  - "3 hotspots; 2,000 endemic plants and 60% habitat loss"
  - "5 hotspots; 1,000 endemic plants and 80% habitat loss"
  correct_answer: "4 hotspots; 1,500 endemic plants and 70% habitat loss"
  explanation: "India is home to four recognized biodiversity hotspots: Western Ghats, Eastern Himalayas, Indo-Burma region (covering Northeast India), and Sundaland (including Nicobar Islands). These hotspots are critical areas for conservation due to their exceptional concentrations of endemic species facing severe threats. According to Norman Myers, who developed this concept, a region qualifies as a biodiversity hotspot if it contains at least 1,500 species of endemic vascular plants (found nowhere else on Earth) and has lost 70% or more of its original habitat. This dual criterion emphasizes both biological richness and conservation urgency. India's biodiversity hotspots harbor thousands of unique plant and animal species, many of which are endangered. The Western Ghats alone contain over 5,000 flowering plants, while the Eastern Himalayas host numerous rare mammals and birds. These hotspots represent less than 2% of Earth's land area but contain over 50% of the world's plant species and 42% of terrestrial vertebrates, making their protection crucial for global biodiversity conservation."

  question: "What is the primary objective of the Paris Agreement (2015), and what are India's three main commitments under it?"
  options:
  - "Limit warming to 3°C; 25% emissions reduction, 30% renewable energy, 1 billion tonnes carbon sink"
  - "Limit warming to below 2°C (preferably 1.5°C); 33-35% emissions intensity reduction, 40% non-fossil fuel power, 2.5-3 billion tonnes carbon sink"
  - "Limit warming to 1°C; 40% emissions reduction, 50% renewable energy, 5 billion tonnes carbon sink"
  - "Limit warming to 2.5°C; 30% emissions reduction, 35% non-fossil fuel power, 2 billion tonnes carbon sink"
  correct_answer: "Limit warming to below 2°C (preferably 1.5°C); 33-35% emissions intensity reduction, 40% non-fossil fuel power, 2.5-3 billion tonnes carbon sink"
  explanation: "The Paris Agreement, adopted at COP21 in 2015, represents a landmark international climate accord with the primary objective of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. This ambitious target aims to prevent catastrophic climate change impacts. India, as one of the world's largest developing economies and third-largest greenhouse gas emitter, made three significant commitments through its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs): First, reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33-35% by 2030 from 2005 levels, which means achieving economic growth while lowering carbon emissions per unit of GDP. Second, achieving about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, promoting renewable energy like solar and wind. Third, creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover. These commitments balance India's development needs with climate action responsibilities, emphasizing sustainable growth while addressing global climate challenges."

  question: "Which international environmental treaty is considered the most successful, and what issue does it address?"
  options:
  - "Kyoto Protocol - greenhouse gas emissions"
  - "Paris Agreement - climate change"
  - "Montreal Protocol - ozone layer depletion"
  - "UNFCCC - global warming"
  correct_answer: "Montreal Protocol - ozone layer depletion"
  explanation: "The Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987, is widely recognized as the most successful international environmental treaty in history. It addresses the critical issue of ozone layer depletion caused by substances like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were commonly used in refrigerants, aerosols, and industrial processes. The stratospheric ozone layer, located 15-35 km above Earth's surface, plays a vital role in protecting life by absorbing harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. The discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica in the 1980s prompted urgent international action. The Montreal Protocol's success stems from several factors: universal ratification by all UN member states, clear phase-out schedules for ozone-depleting substances, provision of financial and technical assistance to developing countries, and regular scientific assessments leading to protocol amendments. As a result of this treaty, the production and consumption of nearly 100 ozone-depleting chemicals have been phased out globally. Scientific evidence shows the ozone layer is recovering and is expected to return to pre-1980 levels by mid-21st century, demonstrating that international cooperation can effectively address global environmental challenges."
