  question: "Which battle in 1757 marked the beginning of British political control in India, and who were the main parties involved?"
  options:
  - "Battle of Buxar; East India Company vs. Mir Qasim"
  - "Battle of Plassey; East India Company under Robert Clive vs. Siraj-ud-Daulah"
  - "Battle of Panipat; British vs. Marathas"
  - "Battle of Mysore; British vs. Tipu Sultan"
  correct_answer: "Battle of Plassey; East India Company under Robert Clive vs. Siraj-ud-Daulah"
  explanation: "The Battle of Plassey, fought on June 23, 1757, was a decisive turning point in Indian history that established British political supremacy in India. The battle was fought between the forces of the East India Company led by Robert Clive and the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj-ud-Daulah. The Company's victory was achieved not through military superiority but primarily through conspiracy and betrayal. Mir Jafar, the commander of Siraj-ud-Daulah's army, along with other nobles, conspired with the British in exchange for promises of the nawabship of Bengal. During the battle near Plassey (Palashi) in West Bengal, Mir Jafar's forces remained inactive, leading to Siraj-ud-Daulah's defeat despite having a much larger army. The victory gave the East India Company control over Bengal's rich resources and revenue, providing the financial foundation for their subsequent expansion across India. Mir Jafar was installed as the puppet Nawab, but real power rested with the Company. This battle demonstrated the Company's strategy of exploiting internal divisions and using political manipulation alongside military force. The wealth extracted from Bengal after Plassey funded further British conquests and laid the groundwork for nearly two centuries of colonial rule in India."

  question: "When did Mahatma Gandhi launch the Quit India Movement, and what was its famous slogan?"
  options:
  - "1930; 'Swaraj is my birthright'"
  - "1942; 'Do or Die'"
  - "1920; 'Non-cooperation'"
  - "1947; 'Jai Hind'"
  correct_answer: "1942; 'Do or Die'"
  explanation: "The Quit India Movement, also known as the August Kranti (August Revolution), was launched by Mahatma Gandhi on August 8, 1942, at the Bombay session of the All India Congress Committee during World War II. Gandhi gave the famous slogan 'Do or Die' (Karo ya Maro), calling for immediate British withdrawal from India. The movement was launched in the context of Britain's weakened position due to World War II and the failure of the Cripps Mission (1942), which offered limited autonomy after the war but was rejected by Indian leaders as inadequate. The Quit India Movement marked a significant shift toward more militant mass resistance against British rule. Gandhi's call was for every Indian to become their own leader in the freedom struggle and act as an independent unit. The British response was severe - within hours of the resolution, Gandhi and other Congress leaders were arrested, remaining imprisoned for most of the war period. Despite leadership being jailed, the movement saw massive participation from students, workers, and peasants across India. There were strikes, demonstrations, attacks on government buildings, and disruption of communication systems. The movement, though suppressed by harsh British measures including mass arrests and firing on protesters, demonstrated the depth of Indian desire for independence and significantly weakened British moral authority, making independence inevitable within five years."

  question: "Who was known as the 'Iron Man of India' for successfully integrating the princely states into independent India?"
  options:
  - "Jawaharlal Nehru"
  - "Mahatma Gandhi"
  - "Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel"
  - "Dr. B.R. Ambedkar"
  correct_answer: "Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel"
  explanation: "Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India's first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, earned the title 'Iron Man of India' (Loha Purush) for his remarkable achievement in integrating 562 princely states into the Indian Union after independence. When British rule ended in 1947, India faced a potential crisis as these princely states, which covered about 40% of India's area, were given the option to join India, Pakistan, or remain independent. This posed a serious threat to India's territorial integrity and unity. Patel, with his deputy V.P. Menon, undertook the monumental task of convincing the rulers to accede to India. Using a combination of diplomatic persuasion, political pressure, and when necessary, the threat or use of force, Patel succeeded in uniting almost all princely states with India by August 15, 1947, or shortly thereafter. Notable cases included Junagadh, where Patel ordered police action after the Nawab chose Pakistan despite a Hindu majority population; Hyderabad, where military action (Operation Polo) in 1948 ended the Nizam's resistance; and Kashmir, which remains disputed. Patel's vision was of a strong, united India, and his firm approach to integration prevented the balkanization of the country. His achievement was particularly remarkable given the short time frame and the diverse nature of these states. Patel's contribution to India's unity is considered as important as the freedom struggle itself."
