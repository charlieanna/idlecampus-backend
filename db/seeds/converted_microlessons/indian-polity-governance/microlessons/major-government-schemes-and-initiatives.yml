  question: "What is the coverage and annual benefit amount provided under the Ayushman Bharat PMJAY scheme?"
  options:
  - "5 crore families; up to Rs 3 lakh per family annually"
  - "10 crore families; up to Rs 5 lakh per family annually"
  - "8 crore families; up to Rs 10 lakh per family annually"
  - "12 crore families; up to Rs 2 lakh per family annually"
  correct_answer: "10 crore families; up to Rs 5 lakh per family annually"
  explanation: "Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), launched in September 2018, is the world's largest health insurance/assurance scheme fully funded by the government. It provides health coverage of up to Rs 5 lakh per family per year to approximately 10 crore (100 million) poor and vulnerable families, covering around 50 crore (500 million) beneficiaries. This flagship scheme aims to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and addresses the financial burden of healthcare costs on poor families. PMJAY provides cashless treatment at empaneled public and private hospitals for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. The scheme covers 1,393 medical procedures including treatments for cancer, heart disease, and kidney ailments. Beneficiaries are identified based on deprivation and occupational criteria from the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) database. The second component of Ayushman Bharat involves establishing 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) to provide comprehensive primary healthcare. PMJAY has significantly reduced out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for poor families, prevented medical bankruptcies, and improved access to quality healthcare. The scheme is paperless, with beneficiaries identified through biometric authentication, ensuring transparency and reducing fraud."

  question: "Under the PM-KISAN scheme, what is the annual amount provided to eligible farmers, and in how many installments is it paid?"
  options:
  - "Rs 8,000 per year in four installments of Rs 2,000 each"
  - "Rs 6,000 per year in three installments of Rs 2,000 each"
  - "Rs 10,000 per year in two installments of Rs 5,000 each"
  - "Rs 5,000 per year in five installments of Rs 1,000 each"
  correct_answer: "Rs 6,000 per year in three installments of Rs 2,000 each"
  explanation: "The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, launched in February 2019, is a central sector scheme providing income support to all landholding farmer families across India. Under this scheme, eligible farmers receive Rs 6,000 per year paid in three equal installments of Rs 2,000 each, transferred directly to their bank accounts through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). The installments are paid every four months (April-July, August-November, December-March). Initially, the scheme covered only small and marginal farmers with combined landholding up to 2 hectares, but it was later expanded to include all farmer families irrespective of landholding size. The objective is to supplement farmers' financial needs for agricultural inputs and household requirements, providing them with regular income throughout the year. This ensures farmers have resources for timely purchase of seeds, fertilizers, and other inputs. PM-KISAN has become one of the world's largest direct cash transfer schemes, covering over 11 crore farmer families. The scheme's implementation through digital technology, including e-KYC and Aadhaar authentication, ensures transparency and reduces leakages. It provides crucial financial support especially during crop failures or low market prices, helping improve agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods."

  question: "What are the key features of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 regarding school structure and language of instruction?"
  options:
  - "10+2 structure; English medium till Class 10"
  - "5+3+3+4 structure; mother tongue/regional language as medium till Class 5"
  - "8+4 structure; Hindi medium till Class 8"
  - "6+3+3 structure; English medium from Class 1"
  correct_answer: "5+3+3+4 structure; mother tongue/regional language as medium till Class 5"
  explanation: "The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, approved in July 2020, represents a comprehensive overhaul of India's education system, replacing the previous policy from 1986. Two major structural changes are the introduction of a 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure and the emphasis on mother tongue/regional language as the medium of instruction. The 5+3+3+4 structure replaces the traditional 10+2 system: the Foundational Stage (5 years: 3 years of pre-primary + Classes 1-2) focuses on play-based, activity-based learning; the Preparatory Stage (3 years: Classes 3-5) develops literacy, numeracy, and basic skills; the Middle Stage (3 years: Classes 6-8) introduces experiential learning and abstract concepts; and the Secondary Stage (4 years: Classes 9-12) offers subject choices with flexibility. This structure is based on cognitive development research and international best practices. Regarding language, NEP 2020 strongly recommends that the medium of instruction until at least Class 5 (preferably till Class 8) should be the mother tongue, home language, or regional language, recognizing that children learn better in familiar languages. The policy also promotes multilingualism, encouraging learning of three languages with flexibility in choice. Other key features include introduction of vocational education from Class 6, multiple entry and exit options in higher education, and emphasis on critical thinking and holistic development rather than rote learning."
