  question: "Which sector of the Indian economy contributes the largest share to GDP, and approximately what percentage does it contribute?"
  options:
  - "Primary sector (Agriculture); ~45% to GDP"
  - "Secondary sector (Industry); ~35% to GDP"
  - "Tertiary sector (Services); ~57% to GDP"
  - "Primary sector (Agriculture); ~25% to GDP"
  correct_answer: "Tertiary sector (Services); ~57% to GDP"
  explanation: "The tertiary or service sector is the largest contributor to India's GDP, accounting for approximately 57% of the total economic output, making it the dominant sector in the Indian economy. This sector includes diverse industries such as information technology (IT), banking, insurance, telecommunications, education, healthcare, tourism, and retail. India's IT and IT-enabled services industry has been particularly significant, with companies like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro establishing India as a global technology hub. The service sector's dominance reflects India's transition from an agriculture-based economy to a more modern, knowledge-based economy. Interestingly, while the service sector contributes over half of GDP, it employs only about 30% of the workforce. In contrast, the primary sector (agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining) contributes only about 18% to GDP but still employs approximately 45% of India's workforce, highlighting a structural imbalance and the need for agricultural productivity improvements. The secondary sector (manufacturing and construction) contributes around 25% to GDP. The government's 'Make in India' initiative aims to boost manufacturing to increase the secondary sector's share, create more jobs, and achieve balanced economic growth across all sectors."

  question: "What does LPG stand for in the context of India's 1991 economic reforms, and what was the primary reason for implementing these reforms?"
  options:
  - "Liquefied Petroleum Gas; energy crisis management"
  - "Liberalization, Privatization, Globalization; economic crisis and balance of payments"
  - "Local Production and Growth; promote domestic industries"
  - "Long-term Planning and Governance; improve government efficiency"
  correct_answer: "Liberalization, Privatization, Globalization; economic crisis and balance of payments"
  explanation: "LPG stands for Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization, representing the three pillars of India's landmark economic reforms initiated in 1991 under Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's government with Dr. Manmohan Singh as Finance Minister. These reforms were implemented primarily in response to a severe economic crisis - India faced a balance of payments crisis with foreign exchange reserves depleted to barely two weeks' worth of imports, and the country was on the verge of defaulting on its international obligations. Liberalization involved reducing government controls and regulations on economic activities, ending the License Raj system that required businesses to obtain numerous permits. Privatization encouraged private sector participation in previously public sector-dominated industries, though complete privatization was limited. Globalization opened India's economy to foreign trade and investment by reducing tariffs, removing quantitative restrictions, and allowing foreign direct investment (FDI) in many sectors. These reforms transformed India from a closed, socialist-inspired economy to a more market-oriented one. The results have been significant: GDP growth accelerated from the 'Hindu rate of growth' of 3-4% to 6-8% annually, foreign investment increased dramatically, and India integrated into the global economy. However, the reforms also brought challenges including income inequality and regional disparities."

  question: "Which organization replaced the Planning Commission in 2015, and what is its key focus area?"
  options:
  - "Finance Commission; tax distribution between center and states"
  - "Reserve Bank of India; monetary policy formulation"
  - "NITI Aayog; cooperative federalism and strategic planning"
  - "Economic Advisory Council; providing economic advice to government"
  correct_answer: "NITI Aayog; cooperative federalism and strategic planning"
  explanation: "The National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog replaced the Planning Commission in January 2015, marking a significant shift in India's approach to economic planning and development. While the Planning Commission, established in 1950, followed a top-down approach with mandatory five-year plans and centralized resource allocation, NITI Aayog adopts a bottom-up approach emphasizing cooperative federalism. The key focus of NITI Aayog is to foster cooperative federalism by involving state governments as equal partners in national development, recognizing that states have diverse needs and priorities. Rather than imposing uniform five-year plans, NITI Aayog develops strategic frameworks including a 15-year vision document, a 7-year strategy, and a 3-year action agenda. It serves as a think tank providing directional and policy inputs to the central and state governments. NITI Aayog promotes competitive and cooperative federalism among states through initiatives like ranking states on various development indicators, encouraging them to learn from each other's best practices. The organization focuses on key areas such as sustainable development goals, technological innovation, and inclusive growth. The Governing Council of NITI Aayog includes the Prime Minister as Chairman and all state Chief Ministers as members, ensuring collaborative policy-making that respects India's federal structure and diverse regional requirements."
