  question: "Which fundamental right did Dr. B.R. Ambedkar call the 'heart and soul' of the Indian Constitution?"
  options:
  - "Right to Equality (Article 14)"
  - "Right to Freedom (Article 19)"
  - "Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32)"
  - "Right to Freedom of Religion (Article 25)"
  correct_answer: "Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32)"
  explanation: "Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, the principal architect of the Indian Constitution, described Article 32 (Right to Constitutional Remedies) as the 'heart and soul' of the Constitution because it provides citizens with the power to move the Supreme Court for enforcement of their fundamental rights. Without this right, all other fundamental rights would be merely theoretical and unenforceable. Article 32 empowers the Supreme Court to issue five types of writs - Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorari, and Quo Warranto - to protect citizens' rights against any violation by the state. This right cannot be suspended except during a national emergency, underscoring its paramount importance. The beauty of Article 32 lies in its accessibility - any citizen can directly approach the Supreme Court if their fundamental rights are violated, without going through lower courts first. This provision has made the Supreme Court the guardian and protector of fundamental rights in India. Over the decades, Article 32 has been instrumental in landmark judgments protecting civil liberties, human rights, and social justice, making it a powerful tool for citizens against arbitrary state action."

  question: "How many fundamental duties are currently enshrined in the Indian Constitution, and through which constitutional amendment were they added?"
  options:
  - "10 duties; 44th Amendment (1978)"
  - "11 duties; 42nd Amendment (1976)"
  - "12 duties; 86th Amendment (2002)"
  - "9 duties; 42nd Amendment (1976)"
  correct_answer: "11 duties; 42nd Amendment (1976)"
  explanation: "The Indian Constitution currently contains 11 Fundamental Duties listed in Article 51A, which were added through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976, often called the 'Mini Constitution' due to the extensive changes it introduced. Originally, only 10 fundamental duties were added in 1976 during the Emergency period under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government, based on the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee. The 11th duty - to provide opportunities for education to children between 6-14 years - was added later through the 86th Amendment Act in 2002. These duties were inspired by the Constitution of the Soviet Union and aim to promote patriotism and uphold the unity of India. The fundamental duties include respecting the Constitution, national flag, and national anthem; cherishing the ideals of the freedom struggle; upholding India's sovereignty and integrity; protecting the environment; developing scientific temper and humanism; and safeguarding public property. While fundamental rights are enforceable by courts, fundamental duties are not legally enforceable but serve as moral obligations reminding citizens of their responsibilities toward the nation and society."

  question: "Which writ literally means 'to produce the body' and is used to protect personal liberty against illegal detention?"
  options:
  - "Mandamus"
  - "Habeas Corpus"
  - "Quo Warranto"
  - "Certiorari"
  correct_answer: "Habeas Corpus"
  explanation: "Habeas Corpus, which literally translates from Latin as 'to have the body' or 'produce the body,' is one of the five writs that can be issued by the Supreme Court and High Courts under Articles 32 and 226 respectively. This writ is specifically designed to protect personal liberty and prevent illegal detention or imprisonment. When a writ of Habeas Corpus is issued, it commands the person or authority detaining someone to produce the detained person before the court and justify the grounds for detention. If the court finds the detention unlawful or without proper legal authority, it can order the immediate release of the person. This writ has historical significance dating back to medieval England and is considered a cornerstone of individual liberty in democratic societies. In India, it has been used extensively to protect citizens from arbitrary arrests and illegal detentions by police or other authorities. The writ can be filed by the detained person themselves or by anyone on their behalf, making it a powerful safeguard against abuse of state power. However, during a national emergency, the right to move court for enforcement of this writ can be suspended, though this has been a subject of significant constitutional debate."
