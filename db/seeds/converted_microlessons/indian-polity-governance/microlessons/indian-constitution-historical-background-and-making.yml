  question: "Who was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution, and how long did it take to complete the Constitution?"
  options:
  - "Jawaharlal Nehru; 3 years, 6 months"
  - "Dr. B.R. Ambedkar; 2 years, 11 months, and 18 days"
  - "Rajendra Prasad; 2 years, 8 months"
  - "Sardar Patel; 3 years, 2 months"
  correct_answer: "Dr. B.R. Ambedkar; 2 years, 11 months, and 18 days"
  explanation: "Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, a renowned jurist, economist, and social reformer, served as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution. The Constituent Assembly, formed in December 1946, took exactly 2 years, 11 months, and 18 days to complete the Constitution, with deliberations spread over 166 days across 11 sessions. Dr. Ambedkar's expertise in constitutional law, combined with his commitment to social justice and equality, profoundly shaped the Constitution. He had studied various constitutions worldwide, including those of the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, incorporating their best features into India's framework. The Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949, and came into effect on January 26, 1950, which is why India celebrates Republic Day on this date. Dr. Ambedkar emphasized fundamental rights, particularly those protecting minorities and disadvantaged groups, reflecting his lifelong struggle against caste discrimination. His vision of a democratic, secular, and egalitarian India is embodied in the Constitution's provisions. The meticulous drafting process involved extensive debates, careful consideration of India's diverse needs, and balancing unity with regional autonomy, making it the longest written constitution of any sovereign nation."

  question: "Which constitutional amendment is known as the 'Mini Constitution' and added the words 'Socialist' and 'Secular' to the Preamble?"
  options:
  - "44th Amendment (1978)"
  - "73rd Amendment (1992)"
  - "42nd Amendment (1976)"
  - "1st Amendment (1951)"
  correct_answer: "42nd Amendment (1976)"
  explanation: "The 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976, enacted during Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government and the Emergency period (1975-77), is known as the 'Mini Constitution' because it brought about the most comprehensive and extensive changes to the Constitution since its adoption. This amendment added the words 'Socialist,' 'Secular,' and 'Integrity' to the Preamble, transforming its opening words to 'Socialist Secular Democratic Republic.' The amendment significantly altered the balance of power between different organs of government and expanded the Directive Principles of State Policy. It added 'Fundamental Duties' (Article 51A) to the Constitution, drawing inspiration from the Soviet Constitution. The amendment also made the President bound by the Cabinet's advice, reduced judicial review powers, and gave Parliament unlimited constituent power. However, many provisions of the 42nd Amendment were subsequently modified or reversed by the 44th Amendment Act of 1978, passed after the Emergency ended, as they were seen as concentrating excessive power in the executive and undermining democratic institutions. Despite these reversals, some important changes like the addition of 'Socialist' and 'Secular' to the Preamble and the inclusion of Fundamental Duties remained, continuing to shape India's constitutional identity."

  question: "What type of government system does India follow, and what is its key characteristic?"
  options:
  - "Presidential form; President is both head of state and government"
  - "Parliamentary form; Nominal head (President) and real head (Prime Minister)"
  - "Federal form; Equal power distribution between center and states"
  - "Unitary form; All powers concentrated at the center"
  correct_answer: "Parliamentary form; Nominal head (President) and real head (Prime Minister)"
  explanation: "India follows the Parliamentary form of government, also known as the Westminster model, borrowed from the British constitutional system. The key characteristic of this system is the distinction between a nominal (ceremonial) head of state and the real head of government. In India, the President serves as the nominal head of state with largely ceremonial powers, while the Prime Minister is the real executive head who wields actual governmental power. The Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister, is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament), meaning the government must maintain the confidence of the majority in the Lok Sabha to remain in power. If the Lok Sabha passes a no-confidence motion, the government must resign. This system ensures parliamentary supremacy and close coordination between the legislature and executive, as most ministers are drawn from Parliament. The Prime Minister and Cabinet make policy decisions and run the government's day-to-day affairs. This contrasts with a Presidential system (like the USA) where the President is both head of state and government with fixed tenure. The Parliamentary system was chosen for India to ensure accountability, flexibility, and representation of diverse political views through coalition governments when necessary."
