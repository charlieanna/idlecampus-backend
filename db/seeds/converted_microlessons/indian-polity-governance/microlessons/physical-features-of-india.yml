  question: "Which is the highest range of the Himalayas, and what is its alternative name?"
  options:
  - "Lesser Himalayas (Himachal)"
  - "Outer Himalayas (Shivaliks)"
  - "Greater Himalayas (Himadri)"
  - "Trans-Himalayas (Karakoram)"
  correct_answer: "Greater Himalayas (Himadri)"
  explanation: "The Greater Himalayas, also known as Himadri (meaning 'abode of snow'), is the highest and most prominent range of the Himalayan mountain system. This range contains the world's highest peaks, including Mount Everest (8,849m), Kanchenjunga (8,586m), and numerous other peaks exceeding 8,000 meters. The Greater Himalayas form a continuous range with an average height of about 6,000 meters and consist of ancient crystalline rocks including granite and gneiss. This range serves as the main watershed between the Indian subcontinent and the Tibetan Plateau, creating a formidable climate barrier that blocks cold Central Asian winds from entering India while trapping monsoon moisture on the southern slopes. The Greater Himalayas are characterized by perpetual snow cover due to their extreme altitude, with extensive glaciation creating glaciers like Gangotri, Yamunotri, and Siachen. The region experiences extreme weather conditions and is largely uninhabited except for some high-altitude settlements and seasonal pastoral activities. Below the Greater Himalayas lies the Lesser Himalayas (Himachal) with average heights of 3,000-4,500m, famous for hill stations like Shimla, Mussoorie, and Darjeeling. The southernmost range is the Outer Himalayas (Shivaliks), composed of unconsolidated sediments with heights of 900-1,200m. The Himalayas are geologically young fold mountains, still rising due to ongoing tectonic activity where the Indian and Eurasian plates collide."

  question: "Which three major rivers deposit alluvium to form the Northern Plains of India?"
  options:
  - "Ganga, Yamuna, Krishna"
  - "Indus, Ganga, Brahmaputra"
  - "Godavari, Mahanadi, Kaveri"
  - "Narmada, Tapti, Ganga"
  correct_answer: "Indus, Ganga, Brahmaputra"
  explanation: "The Northern Plains of India, one of the world's most extensive and fertile alluvial plains, were formed by the depositional activity of three mighty Himalayan river systems: the Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra, along with their numerous tributaries. Over millions of years, these rivers have carried vast amounts of sediment eroded from the Himalayas and deposited it in the depression between the Himalayas and the Peninsular Plateau, creating a flat, highly fertile plain stretching about 2,400 km from east to west and 150-300 km from north to south, covering approximately 7 lakh square kilometers. The Indus and its tributaries (Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, Sutlej) formed the Punjab Plains primarily in Pakistan, with a small portion in India. The Ganga and its tributaries (Yamuna, Ghaghra, Gandak, Kosi) created the most extensive Ganga Plains stretching from Uttarakhand to West Bengal. The Brahmaputra formed the Brahmaputra Plains (Assam valley) in the northeast. These plains are characterized by different soil zones: Bhabar (pebble deposits at the Himalayan foothills where streams disappear underground), Terai (marshy, forested region where underground streams re-emerge), Bhangar (older alluvial terraces with kankar nodules), and Khadar (newer alluvial deposits in floodplains). The Northern Plains support intensive agriculture, house major cities, and contain about 40% of India's population, making them economically and demographically crucial to the nation."

  question: "Which major peninsular river flows westward in a rift valley, unlike most peninsular rivers that flow eastward?"
  options:
  - "Godavari"
  - "Krishna"
  - "Narmada"
  - "Kaveri"
  correct_answer: "Narmada"
  explanation: "The Narmada River is one of only two major peninsular rivers (along with Tapti) that flows westward, unlike most peninsular rivers that flow eastward into the Bay of Bengal. What makes the Narmada particularly unique is that it flows through a rift valley - a linear depression formed by faulting and sinking of land between two parallel faults. The Narmada originates from the Amarkantak Plateau in Madhya Pradesh at an elevation of about 1,057 meters and flows westward for approximately 1,312 km before emptying into the Arabian Sea through the Gulf of Khambhat. The rift valley through which it flows is bounded by the Satpura Range to the south and the Vindhya Range to the north, creating a narrow, straight valley unlike the typical drainage patterns of other peninsular rivers. This rift valley is one of India's most prominent structural features and is geologically significant as it represents a major fault zone. The river creates spectacular features including the Dhuandhar Falls near Jabalpur and the famous Marble Rocks gorge. The Narmada is considered sacred in Hindu tradition and is one of the seven holy rivers. The river's westward flow and rift valley location give it distinct characteristics: it has relatively steeper gradients, doesn't form an extensive delta like eastward-flowing rivers, and has fewer tributaries compared to rivers like Godavari and Krishna which have dendritic drainage patterns with numerous tributaries."
