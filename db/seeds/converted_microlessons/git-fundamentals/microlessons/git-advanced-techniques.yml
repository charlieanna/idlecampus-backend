  # Advanced Git Techniques 🧙‍♂️

  # Git Rebase

  Rewrites history to make it linear. Moves your commits to the tip of another branch.

  ```bash
  # Situation:
  # main:    A --- B
  # feature:        \--- C

  git checkout feature
  git rebase main

  # Result (linear history):
  # A --- B --- C'
  ```

  **Warning:** NEVER rebase public branches (shared with others). Only rebase local branches before pushing.

  # Git Cherry-Pick

  Apply a specific commit from one branch to another.

  ```bash
  git cherry-pick abc1234
  ```

  Useful for:
  - Backporting bug fixes to older versions.
  - Picking one feature from a abandoned branch.

  # Git Stash

  Temporarily save uncommitted changes to clean your working directory.

  ```bash
  # Save changes
  git stash

  # List stashes
  git stash list

  # Apply last stash
  git stash pop
  ```

  # Git Reset

  Undo changes.

  - **Soft:** Moves HEAD, keeps changes staged.
  - **Mixed (default):** Moves HEAD, keeps changes unstaged.
  - **Hard:** Moves HEAD, destroys changes.

  ```bash
  # Undo last commit, keep changes
  git reset --soft HEAD~1

  # DESTROY last commit and changes
  git reset --hard HEAD~1
  ```

    question: "When is it safe to use 'git rebase'?"
    options:
      - "On shared branches like main"
      - "On local feature branches before pushing"
      - "Never"
      - "Always"
    correct_answer: "On local feature branches before pushing"
    explanation: "Rebase rewrites history. If you rewrite history that others have pulled, it causes massive sync headaches. Only rebase branches that only you are working on."
