  # Git Remotes and Collaboration 🌍

  # Working with Remotes

  Remotes are versions of your project hosted on the internet or network (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

  ## Managing Remotes

  ```bash
  # View remotes
  git remote -v

  # Add a remote
  git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

  # Remove a remote
  git remote remove origin

  # Rename a remote
  git remote rename origin upstream
  ```

  ## Pushing Code

  Upload your local commits to a remote.

  ```bash
  # Push current branch to 'origin' remote
  git push origin main

  # Push and set upstream (tracking)
  git push -u origin feature/login
  # After -u, you can just type 'git push'
  ```

  ## Fetching vs Pulling

  ### git fetch

  Downloads commits/branches from remote but **does not** merge them. Safe to run anytime.

  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  ```

  ### git pull

  Downloads **AND** merges. Equivalent to `git fetch` + `git merge`.

  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

  **Warning:** `git pull` can generate merge conflicts if your local history has diverged from remote.

  ## Best Practice Workflow

  1. **Fetch first:** See what changed.
  2. **Pull changes:** Update your local branch.
  3. **Work:** Commit your changes.
  4. **Push:** Share your work.

  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout -b feature/new-stuff
  # ... work ...
  git push -u origin feature/new-stuff
  ```

    question: "What is the difference between 'git fetch' and 'git pull'?"
    options:
      - "They are identical"
      - "Fetch downloads changes without merging; Pull downloads and merges"
      - "Pull downloads changes without merging; Fetch downloads and merges"
      - "Fetch uploads changes; Pull downloads changes"
    correct_answer: "Fetch downloads changes without merging; Pull downloads and merges"
    explanation: "git fetch is safe - it updates your remote-tracking branches (like origin/main) but doesn't touch your working files. git pull is aggressive - it fetches and then immediately tries to merge into your current branch."
