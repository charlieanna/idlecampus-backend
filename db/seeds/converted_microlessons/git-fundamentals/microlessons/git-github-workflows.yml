  # GitHub Workflows and Pull Requests 🐙

  # The Pull Request (PR) Workflow

  The standard way to collaborate on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

  ## Steps

  1. **Branch:** Create a feature branch locally.
  2. **Commit:** Do your work.
  3. **Push:** Push branch to remote.
  4. **Open PR:** Go to GitHub UI, click "New Pull Request".
  5. **Review:** Teammates comment on code.
  6. **Merge:** Once approved, click "Merge Pull Request".

  ## Forking Workflow (Open Source)

  1. **Fork:** Create a personal copy of someone else's repo.
  2. **Clone:** Clone your fork.
  3. **Work:** Push changes to your fork.
  4. **PR:** Open PR from **your fork** to the **original repo**.

  ## Code Review Etiquette

  - **Be constructive:** Critique code, not people.
  - **Explain why:** Don't just say "change this", explain the benefit.
  - **Test locally:** Don't assume it works just by reading.

  ## Issues and Labels

  - **Issues:** Track bugs and feature requests.
  - **Labels:** Categorize issues (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`).
  - **Closing:** Use keywords in PRs like "Closes #123" to auto-close issues.

    question: "What is a Pull Request?"
    options:
      - "A request to pull changes from a remote to local"
      - "A request to merge changes from one branch into another, usually involving code review"
      - "A command to download the latest code"
      - "A request to delete a repository"
    correct_answer: "A request to merge changes from one branch into another, usually involving code review"
    explanation: "A Pull Request (PR) is a platform feature (not a Git command) where you ask maintainers to 'pull' your changes into their branch. It is the primary venue for code review and discussion."

    question: "What does 'Forking' a repository do?"
    options:
      - "Creates a new branch"
      - "Creates a personal copy of the entire repository under your account"
      - "Deletes the repository"
      - "Downloads the repository to your computer"
    correct_answer: "Creates a personal copy of the entire repository under your account"
    explanation: "Forking creates a server-side copy of a repository. It allows you to experiment freely without affecting the original project. You can then contribute back via Pull Requests."
