  question: For the equation $$x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$$, find the sum of the roots
  options:
  - '5'
  - '-5'
  - '6'
  - '1'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '5'
  explanation: 'For a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of roots is given
    by the formula: Sum of roots = -b/a. Given equation: x² - 5x + 6 = 0. Here a =
    1, b = -5, c = 6. Sum of roots = -(-5)/1 = 5. We can verify by factoring: x² -
    5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, giving roots α = 2 and β = 3. Sum = 2 + 3 = 5 ✓.
    The relationship between roots and coefficients (Vieta''s formulas): For ax² +
    bx + c = 0 with roots α, β: Sum of roots: α + β = -b/a, Product of roots: α·β
    = c/a. For our equation: Product = 6/1 = 6, verified: 2×3 = 6 ✓. These formulas
    allow us to find sum and product without actually solving for the roots, which
    is useful when roots are irrational or complex.'

  question: 'For the equation 2x² + 3x - 5 = 0, find the product of the roots.'
  options:
  - '-5/2'
  - '5/2'
  - '-3/2'
  - '3/2'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '-5/2'
  explanation: 'Using **Vieta''s formula**: For ax² + bx + c = 0, product of roots
    = c/a. Given equation: 2x² + 3x - 5 = 0. Here a = 2, b = 3, c = -5. Product of
    roots = c/a = -5/2. **Verification by solving**: Using quadratic formula: x =
    [-3 ± √(9 + 40)]/4 = [-3 ± 7]/4. Roots: α = (-3+7)/4 = 1, β = (-3-7)/4 = -5/2.
    Product: α·β = 1 × (-5/2) = -5/2 ✓. **Sum of roots**: -b/a = -3/2 (verify: 1
    + (-5/2) = 2/2 - 5/2 = -3/2 ✓). **Sign of product**: Product < 0 means roots
    have opposite signs (one positive, one negative). Product > 0 means roots have
    same sign. Product = 0 means one root is zero.'

  question: 'Form a quadratic equation whose roots are 3 and -2.'
  options:
  - x² - x - 6 = 0
  - x² + x - 6 = 0
  - x² - x + 6 = 0
  - x² + x + 6 = 0
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: x² - x - 6 = 0
  explanation: 'If α and β are roots, the quadratic equation is: x² - (α+β)x + αβ
    = 0 or x² - (sum of roots)x + (product of roots) = 0. Given roots: α = 3, β
    = -2. Sum of roots: α + β = 3 + (-2) = 1. Product of roots: α·β = 3 × (-2) =
    -6. **Equation**: x² - (1)x + (-6) = 0, which simplifies to x² - x - 6 = 0.
    **Verification by factoring**: x² - x - 6 = (x - 3)(x + 2) = 0, giving x = 3
    or x = -2 ✓. **General method**: Given roots α, β: (1) Find sum = α + β and
    product = αβ, (2) Substitute into x² - (sum)x + (product) = 0, (3) Or directly
    write as (x - α)(x - β) = 0 and expand. **Example**: Equation with roots 5 and
    -1: x² - (5-1)x + 5(-1) = 0 → x² - 4x - 5 = 0.'
