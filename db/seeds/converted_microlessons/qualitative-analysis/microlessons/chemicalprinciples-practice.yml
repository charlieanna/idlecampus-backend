  In acidic medium, [H⁺] is high which keeps [S²⁻] low (due to H₂S ⇌ 2H⁺ + S²⁻). This
  allows only Group II cations with very low Ksp to precipitate, while Group IV remains
  in solution.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Why is H₂S added in acidic medium for Group II precipitation?
  options:
  - To maintain low S²⁻ concentration, precipitating only Group II sulfides (low Ksp)
  - To increase solubility of all sulfides
  - To prevent H₂S from decomposing
  - To make the solution neutral for precipitation
  correct_answer: To maintain low S²⁻ concentration, precipitating only Group II sulfides (low Ksp)
  explanation: "In acidic medium, high [H⁺] shifts the equilibrium H₂S ⇌ 2H⁺ + S²⁻ to the left, keeping [S²⁻] very low. At this low [S²⁻], only Group II sulfides with very low Ksp values precipitate. Group IV sulfides have higher Ksp and remain in solution until basic medium increases [S²⁻]."

  question: What is the chemical principle behind selective precipitation in qualitative analysis?
  options:
  - Controlling common ion concentration to exceed Ksp
  - Adding excess water
  - Increasing temperature
  - Adding random reagents
  correct_answer: Controlling common ion concentration to exceed Ksp
  explanation: "Selective precipitation works by controlling the concentration of common ions (like S²⁻, OH⁻, Cl⁻) so that the ionic product [M^n+][X^m-] exceeds Ksp only for the target group. For example, low [S²⁻] in acid precipitates only low-Ksp Group II sulfides, while high [S²⁻] in base precipitates higher-Ksp Group IV sulfides."

  question: The common ion effect is used in qualitative analysis to
  options:
  - Control precipitation and prevent interference
  - Increase solubility
  - Speed up reactions
  - Change colors
  correct_answer: Control precipitation and prevent interference
  explanation: "Common ion effect is extensively used in qualitative analysis. Examples: (1) NH₄Cl suppresses [OH⁻] from NH₄OH, preventing Group IV precipitation during Group III analysis, (2) HCl controls [S²⁻] from H₂S for selective Group II precipitation. By controlling ion concentrations, we achieve selective separation."
