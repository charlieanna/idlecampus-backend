  NH₄Cl acts as a buffer and suppresses excess OH⁻ concentration (common ion effect),
  preventing premature precipitation of Group IV cations.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'NH₄Cl is added along with NH₄OH during Group III precipitation to:'
  options:
  - Prevent precipitation of Group IV (suppress [OH⁻])
  - Increase pH of solution
  - Help dissolve Group II sulfides
  - Act as a catalyst
  correct_answer: Prevent precipitation of Group IV (suppress [OH⁻])
  explanation: "NH₄Cl provides NH₄⁺ ions which suppress the dissociation of NH₄OH through common ion effect: NH₄OH ⇌ NH₄⁺ + OH⁻. This keeps [OH⁻] low enough to precipitate only Group III hydroxides (Fe³⁺, Al³⁺, Cr³⁺ with lower Ksp) but not Group IV (Ca²⁺, Ba²⁺, Sr²⁺ with higher Ksp)."

  question: How is Group II (sulfide group) separated into subgroups?
  options:
  - Using dilute HNO₃ (dissolves As₂S₃, Sb₂S₃, SnS₂)
  - Using aqua regia
  - Using NaOH
  - Using HCl
  correct_answer: Using dilute HNO₃ (dissolves As₂S₃, Sb₂S₃, SnS₂)
  explanation: "Group II is separated into two subgroups: (1) Group IIA (Cu²⁺, Hg²⁺, Cd²⁺, Bi³⁺ sulfides) - insoluble in dilute HNO₃, (2) Group IIB (As³⁺, Sb³⁺, Sn²⁺ sulfides) - soluble in dilute HNO₃. This separation is based on the oxidizing action of dilute HNO₃ which dissolves As₂S₃, Sb₂S₃, and SnS₂."

  question: What is used to separate Pb²⁺ from Group I precipitate?
  options:
  - Hot water (PbCl₂ is soluble in hot water)
  - Cold water
  - NH₄OH
  - HNO₃
  correct_answer: Hot water (PbCl₂ is soluble in hot water)
  explanation: "PbCl₂ is soluble in hot water while AgCl and Hg₂Cl₂ are not. Therefore, the Group I precipitate is washed with hot water to dissolve PbCl₂, separating Pb²⁺ from Ag⁺ and Hg₂²⁺. On cooling, PbCl₂ recrystallizes as white needle-shaped crystals."
