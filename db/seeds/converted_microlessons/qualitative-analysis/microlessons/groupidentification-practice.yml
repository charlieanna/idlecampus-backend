  Group II sulfides: HgS (black), CuS (black/brown), CdS (yellow), Bi₂S₃ (brown),
  As₂S₃ (yellow), Sb₂S₃ (orange), SnS₂ (yellow). Pb²⁺ is Group I, not II.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following give colored sulfide precipitates in Group II?
  options:
  - HgS (black), CuS (black), CdS (yellow)
  - All Group II sulfides are white
  - PbS (black)
  - ZnS (white)
  correct_answer: HgS (black), CuS (black), CdS (yellow)
  explanation: "Group II sulfides are colored: HgS (black), CuS (black/brown), CdS (yellow), Bi₂S₃ (brown), As₂S₃ (yellow), Sb₂S₃ (orange), SnS₂ (yellow). These colors help in identification. PbS is Group I (though it forms black precipitate), and ZnS is Group IV (white)."

  question: What color is the precipitate of CdS?
  options:
  - Yellow
  - Black
  - White
  - Orange
  correct_answer: Yellow
  explanation: "Cadmium sulfide (CdS) forms a bright yellow precipitate when H₂S is passed through acidic solution containing Cd²⁺. This characteristic yellow color helps identify cadmium in Group II analysis."

  question: Which of the following is NOT a Group II sulfide?
  options:
  - CuS
  - ZnS
  - HgS
  - Bi₂S₃
  correct_answer: ZnS
  explanation: "ZnS is a Group IV sulfide, not Group II. It precipitates when H₂S is passed in basic medium (with NH₄OH + NH₄Cl). Group II sulfides (CuS, HgS, Bi₂S₃, CdS, As₂S₃, Sb₂S₃, SnS₂) precipitate in acidic medium due to their very low Ksp values."
