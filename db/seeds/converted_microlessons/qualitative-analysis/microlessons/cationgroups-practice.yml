  Group II includes cations precipitated by H₂S in acidic medium: Hg²⁺, Cu²⁺, Cd²⁺,
  Bi³⁺, As³⁺, Sb³⁺, Sn²⁺. Zn²⁺ is Group IV, Pb²⁺ is Group I.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following cations belong to Group II?
  options:
  - Hg²⁺, Cu²⁺, Cd²⁺
  - Zn²⁺, Ni²⁺, Co²⁺
  - Pb²⁺, Ag⁺, Hg₂²⁺
  - Fe³⁺, Al³⁺, Cr³⁺
  correct_answer: Hg²⁺, Cu²⁺, Cd²⁺
  explanation: "Group II includes cations precipitated by H₂S in acidic medium: Hg²⁺, Cu²⁺, Cd²⁺, Bi³⁺, As³⁺, Sb³⁺, Sn²⁺. Group I has Pb²⁺, Ag⁺, Hg₂²⁺ (precipitated by dil HCl). Group IV has Zn²⁺, Ni²⁺, Co²⁺, Mn²⁺ (precipitated by H₂S in basic medium). Group III has Fe³⁺, Al³⁺, Cr³⁺ (precipitated by NH₄OH)."

  question: Which group reagent is used to precipitate Group I cations?
  options:
  - Dilute HCl
  - H₂S in acidic medium
  - H₂S in basic medium
  - NH₄OH + NH₄Cl
  correct_answer: Dilute HCl
  explanation: "Group I cations (Pb²⁺, Ag⁺, Hg₂²⁺) are precipitated by dilute HCl as insoluble chlorides: PbCl₂ (white), AgCl (white), Hg₂Cl₂ (white). This is the first step in systematic qualitative analysis of cations."

  question: Group III cations are precipitated by
  options:
  - H₂S in acidic medium
  - NH₄OH in presence of NH₄Cl
  - H₂S in basic medium
  - (NH₄)₂CO₃
  correct_answer: NH₄OH in presence of NH₄Cl
  explanation: "Group III cations (Fe³⁺, Al³⁺, Cr³⁺) are precipitated as hydroxides by NH₄OH in the presence of NH₄Cl. NH₄Cl prevents precipitation of Group IV by suppressing [OH⁻] through common ion effect. The hydroxides formed are: Fe(OH)₃ (reddish brown), Al(OH)₃ (white), Cr(OH)₃ (green)."
