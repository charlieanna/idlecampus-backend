  FALSE. Group IV cations (Zn²⁺, Ni²⁺, Co²⁺, Mn²⁺) are precipitated by H₂S in BASIC
  medium (NH₄OH + NH₄Cl). Acidic medium is used for Group II.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: In which medium does H₂S precipitate Group IV cations?
  options:
  - Basic medium (NH₄OH + NH₄Cl)
  - Acidic medium (HCl)
  - Neutral medium
  - Strong alkaline medium
  correct_answer: Basic medium (NH₄OH + NH₄Cl)
  explanation: "Group IV cations (Zn²⁺, Ni²⁺, Co²⁺, Mn²⁺) are precipitated by H₂S in BASIC medium (NH₄OH + NH₄Cl), not acidic medium. In basic medium, [S²⁻] is high enough to precipitate Group IV sulfides. Acidic medium is used for Group II cations."

  question: What is the group reagent for Group V cations?
  options:
  - (NH₄)₂CO₃
  - H₂S in acidic medium
  - Dilute HCl
  - NH₄OH
  correct_answer: (NH₄)₂CO₃
  explanation: "Group V cations (Ba²⁺, Sr²⁺, Ca²⁺) are precipitated as carbonates by (NH₄)₂CO₃ in the presence of NH₄Cl and NH₄OH. The precipitates are: BaCO₃ (white), SrCO₃ (white), CaCO₃ (white). Mg²⁺ does not precipitate and remains in Group VI."

  question: Which group reagent is used for Group II analysis?
  options:
  - H₂S in acidic medium (HCl)
  - H₂S in basic medium
  - Dilute HCl
  - (NH₄)₂CO₃
  correct_answer: H₂S in acidic medium (HCl)
  explanation: "H₂S in acidic medium (dilute HCl) is the group reagent for Group II. It precipitates sulfides of Hg²⁺, Cu²⁺, Cd²⁺, Bi³⁺, As³⁺, Sb³⁺, Sn²⁺ due to their very low Ksp values. The acidic medium keeps [S²⁻] low, ensuring selective precipitation of only Group II."
