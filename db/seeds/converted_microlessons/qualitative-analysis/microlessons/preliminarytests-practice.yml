  question: The flame test for sodium gives which color?
  options:
  - Golden yellow
  - Crimson red
  - Apple green
  - Violet
  correct_answer: Golden yellow
  explanation: "Sodium (Na⁺) produces a characteristic golden yellow flame color, which is persistent and intense. This is one of the most easily recognized flame colors in qualitative analysis. The color is due to electronic transitions in sodium atoms."

  question: What color flame does calcium produce in a flame test?
  options:
  - Brick red
  - Golden yellow
  - Violet
  - Green
  correct_answer: Brick red
  explanation: "Calcium (Ca²⁺) gives a brick red or orange-red flame color. Other flame colors: K⁺ (violet/lilac), Ba²⁺ (apple green), Sr²⁺ (crimson red), Cu²⁺ (blue-green). The flame test is a preliminary test for identifying cations."

  question: Which preliminary test uses cobalt glass to observe the flame?
  options:
  - Potassium (to mask sodium yellow)
  - Sodium
  - Calcium
  - Barium
  correct_answer: Potassium (to mask sodium yellow)
  explanation: "Cobalt glass is used to observe the violet flame of potassium (K⁺) because it filters out the intense yellow color of sodium which may be present as an impurity. Through cobalt glass, the violet flame of K⁺ can be clearly seen while the yellow of Na⁺ is absorbed."
