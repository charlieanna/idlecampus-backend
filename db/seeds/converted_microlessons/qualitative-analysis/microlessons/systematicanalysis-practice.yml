  Systematic analysis follows the sequence: Group 0 → I → II → III → IV → V → VI.
  This ensures complete separation without interference.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the correct order of groups in systematic cation analysis?
  options:
  - Group I → II → III → IV → V → VI
  - Group VI → V → IV → III → II → I
  - Group II → I → III → IV → V → VI
  - Group I → III → II → IV → V → VI
  correct_answer: Group I → II → III → IV → V → VI
  explanation: "Systematic cation analysis follows the sequence: Group I (dil HCl) → Group II (H₂S in acidic) → Group III (NH₄OH + NH₄Cl) → Group IV (H₂S in basic) → Group V ((NH₄)₂CO₃) → Group VI (remaining). This sequence ensures complete separation without interference between groups."

  sequence_order: 2
  question: Why is Group I analyzed first in systematic analysis?
  options:
  - Because dilute HCl precipitates only Group I cations
  - Because it has the most cations
  - Because it's the easiest group
  - Random order
  correct_answer: Because dilute HCl precipitates only Group I cations
  explanation: "Group I is analyzed first because dilute HCl selectively precipitates only Pb²⁺, Ag⁺, and Hg₂²⁺ as insoluble chlorides, without affecting other groups. This allows clean separation. The filtrate is then used for subsequent group analysis."

  question: What happens if we don't follow the systematic order?
  options:
  - Interference between groups, incomplete separation
  - No effect on results
  - Faster analysis
  - Better precipitation
  correct_answer: Interference between groups, incomplete separation
  explanation: "If systematic order is not followed, there will be interference between groups leading to incomplete separation and inaccurate results. For example, if Group III is analyzed before Group II, the NH₄OH used for Group III would interfere with Group II analysis. The systematic sequence is designed to prevent such cross-contamination."
