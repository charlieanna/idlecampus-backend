  In diamond, each C is sp³ hybridized and forms 4 covalent bonds in a tetrahedral
  arrangement, creating a 3D network structure.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to how many other carbon atoms?
  options:
  - '2'
  - '3'
  - '4'
  - '6'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '4'
  explanation: 'In diamond, each carbon atom is sp³ hybridized and forms 4 covalent
    bonds with 4 other carbon atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. This creates a
    rigid 3D network structure. Properties of diamond: (1) Hardest natural substance
    (each C bonded to 4 others = very strong), (2) High melting point (~3550°C),
    (3) Poor electrical conductor (no free electrons), (4) Transparent, (5) High
    refractive index. The C-C bond length is 154 pm, and bond angle is 109.5° (tetrahedral).
    Each C uses all 4 valence electrons in bonding, leaving no free electrons for
    conduction. Diamond is a giant covalent structure.'

  question: Which allotrope of carbon is a good conductor of electricity?
  options:
  - Diamond
  - Graphite
  - Fullerene C₆₀
  - All are insulators
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Graphite
  explanation: 'Graphite is a good conductor of electricity (along the planes), unlike
    diamond which is an insulator. In graphite: Each C is sp² hybridized forming
    3 sigma bonds in hexagonal layers. The 4th electron is in unhybridized p-orbital
    perpendicular to the plane, forming delocalized π bonds. These delocalized electrons
    are free to move along the planes, allowing electrical conduction. Structure:
    Hexagonal layers with C-C bond length 142 pm within layers, 340 pm between layers
    (weak van der Waals forces). Properties: (1) Good conductor along planes, (2)
    Soft and slippery (layers slide), (3) High melting point (~3600°C), (4) Black
    and opaque. Uses: Electrodes, lubricants, pencil lead.'

  question: What is the hybridization of carbon in fullerene C₆₀?
  options:
  - sp
  - sp²
  - sp³
  - sp³d
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: sp²
  explanation: 'In fullerene C₆₀ (Buckminsterfullerene or buckyball), each carbon
    is sp² hybridized, similar to graphite. Structure: 60 carbon atoms arranged in
    a soccer ball shape with 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal faces. Each C forms 3
    sigma bonds with neighboring C atoms. However, unlike planar graphite, the structure
    is curved due to pentagonal rings introducing curvature. The C-C bonds are not
    all equal length (different in pentagons vs hexagons). Properties: (1) Cage-like
    structure with hollow interior, (2) Can encapsulate atoms/molecules inside, (3)
    Superconductor when doped with alkali metals (K₃C₆₀), (4) Dissolves in benzene.
    Discovery: 1985 by Kroto, Smalley, Curl (Nobel Prize 1996). Other fullerenes:
    C₇₀, C₈₄, carbon nanotubes.'
