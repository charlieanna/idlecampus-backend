  Inert pair effect increases down the group. Thallium shows the strongest effect,
  with Tl⁺ being more stable than Tl³⁺ due to poor shielding by 4f and 5d electrons.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which element in Group 13 shows the strongest inert pair effect?
  options:
  - Boron
  - Aluminium
  - Gallium
  - Thallium
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Thallium
  explanation: 'Thallium (Tl) shows the strongest inert pair effect in Group 13 (Boron
    family: B, Al, Ga, In, Tl). The inert pair effect is the tendency of the ns² electron
    pair to remain non-ionized or unshared in bonding, making the lower oxidation
    state (n)⁺ more stable than the group oxidation state (n+2)⁺. For Tl: Tl⁺ is more
    stable than Tl³⁺. Reasons: (1) **Poor shielding**: The filled 4f¹⁴ and 5d¹⁰ subshells
    provide poor shielding of the 6s² electrons from nuclear charge, (2) **Relativistic
    contraction**: The 6s orbital contracts and becomes more tightly bound due to
    relativistic effects (electrons moving at significant fraction of speed of light),
    (3) **High energy required**: Removing both 6s electrons requires very high energy.
    The trend down Group 13: B and Al show only +3 state, Ga shows weak inert pair
    effect (both +1 and +3), In shows moderate effect (Ln⁺ exists), Tl shows strong
    effect (Tl⁺ is MORE stable than Tl³⁺). Similarly, in Group 14: Pb²⁺ > Pb⁴⁺; Group
    15: Bi³⁺ > Bi⁺⁵. This affects chemistry: TlCl is more stable than TlCl₃, unlike
    AlCl₃ which is very stable.'

  question: In which group does the inert pair effect become more pronounced down
    the group?
  options:
  - Group 1 (Alkali metals)
  - Group 13, 14, 15 (p-block elements)
  - Group 18 (Noble gases)
  - Group 2 (Alkaline earth metals)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Group 13, 14, 15 (p-block elements)
  explanation: 'The inert pair effect becomes more pronounced down Groups 13, 14,
    and 15 (heavier p-block elements). The effect increases down the group because:
    (1) Larger atoms have more inner filled subshells (especially 4f, 5d), (2) These
    filled f and d subshells provide poor shielding, (3) ns² electrons experience
    stronger effective nuclear charge and are harder to remove, (4) Relativistic
    effects become significant for heavy elements. Examples by group: Group 13: Tl⁺
    > Tl³⁺ (strong), In⁺ < In³⁺ (moderate), Ga⁺ < Ga³⁺ (weak), Al only +3, B only
    +3. Group 14: Pb²⁺ > Pb⁴⁺ (PbO more stable than PbO₂), Sn²⁺ < Sn⁴⁺ (moderate),
    Ge⁴⁺ preferred. Group 15: Bi³⁺ > Bi⁵⁺, Sb³⁺ ≈ Sb⁵⁺, As⁵⁺ preferred. This affects
    chemistry significantly - Tl₂O and PbO are more stable than Tl₂O₃ and PbO₂.'

  question: What is the primary reason for the inert pair effect?
  options:
  - Increased atomic size
  - Poor shielding by filled d and f orbitals
  - High electronegativity
  - Strong metallic bonding
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Poor shielding by filled d and f orbitals
  explanation: 'The primary reason for the inert pair effect is poor shielding of
    ns² electrons by filled (n-1)d¹⁰ and (n-2)f¹⁴ subshells. Mechanism: (1) As we
    go down the group, electrons are added to f and d orbitals before the ns² electrons,
    (2) The f and d orbitals have diffuse shapes and don''t effectively shield the
    ns² electrons from nuclear charge, (3) The ns² electrons experience higher effective
    nuclear charge (Zeff) and are pulled closer to nucleus, (4) Removing ns² electrons
    requires very high ionization energy. Additional factors: (1) Relativistic contraction
    of s orbitals (significant for 6s in Tl, Pb, Bi), (2) Large energy gap between
    ns and np orbitals. Consequence: The lower oxidation state (ns²np⁰ lost only
    np electrons) becomes more stable than higher oxidation state (lost both ns² and
    np electrons). Examples: Tl⁺ more stable than Tl³⁺, Pb²⁺ more stable than Pb⁴⁺.'
