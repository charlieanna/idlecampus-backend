  question: How does boric acid (H₃BO₃) act as an acid in water?
  options:
  - By donating H⁺ ions (Brønsted acid)
  - By accepting OH⁻ ions (Lewis acid)
  - By accepting H⁺ ions
  - By donating electrons
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: By accepting OH⁻ ions (Lewis acid)
  explanation: 'Boric acid (H₃BO₃ or B(OH)₃) acts as a Lewis acid by accepting OH⁻
    ions from water, NOT by donating H⁺ (so it''s NOT a Brønsted acid). Reaction:
    B(OH)₃ + 2H₂O → [B(OH)₄]⁻ + H₃O⁺ (or simplified: B(OH)₃ + H₂O → [B(OH)₄]⁻ +
    H⁺). Boron in B(OH)₃ is electron-deficient (only 6 electrons in valence shell)
    and accepts an electron pair from OH⁻ to complete its octet, forming tetrahedral
    [B(OH)₄]⁻. The H₃O⁺ formed makes solution acidic. Boric acid is a weak monobasic
    acid (Ka ~5.8 × 10⁻¹⁰, pKa ~9.2). Properties: White crystalline solid, antiseptic,
    used in eye wash. This Lewis acid behavior is characteristic of boron compounds
    due to incomplete octet.'

  question: What is the structure of diborane (B₂H₆)?
  options:
  - Two BH₃ molecules connected by a B-B bond
  - Bridge structure with 3-center-2-electron bonds
  - Linear structure with alternating B and H
  - Tetrahedral structure around each B
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Bridge structure with 3-center-2-electron bonds
  explanation: 'Diborane (B₂H₆) has a unique bridge structure with two types of hydrogen
    atoms: Terminal H (4 atoms): Form normal 2-center-2-electron B-H bonds. Bridge
    H (2 atoms): Form unusual 3-center-2-electron (3c-2e) bonds, also called banana
    bonds. Structure: Two BH₂ groups connected by 2 bridge H atoms. Each bridge H
    forms a 3c-2e bond involving 2 B atoms and 1 H atom sharing just 2 electrons.
    This occurs because B is electron-deficient (only 3 valence electrons). The molecule
    has D₂h symmetry. B-H bond lengths: Terminal B-H = 119 pm, Bridge B-H = 133 pm
    (longer/weaker). Diborane is highly reactive, used as rocket fuel, reducing agent.
    Hydrolysis: B₂H₆ + 6H₂O → 2B(OH)₃ + 6H₂. Other electron-deficient hydrides: Al₂H₆,
    Be₂H₄.'

  question: Which property is characteristic of borax (Na₂B₄O₇·10H₂O)?
  options:
  - Strong oxidizing agent
  - Forms colored solutions
  - Shows basic properties when dissolved in water
  - Good electrical conductor in solid state
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Shows basic properties when dissolved in water
  explanation: 'Borax (Na₂B₄O₇·10H₂O or sodium tetraborate decahydrate) shows basic
    properties when dissolved in water due to hydrolysis. In water: Na₂B₄O₇ + 7H₂O
    → 2NaOH + 4H₃BO₃ (or simplified: B₄O₇²⁻ + 7H₂O → 4H₃BO₃ + 2OH⁻). The formation
    of OH⁻ ions makes the solution basic (pH ~9-10). Uses: (1) Water softening (precipitates
    Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺), (2) Detergents and soaps, (3) Borax bead test for metal ions (forms
    colored metaborates), (4) Glass and enamel manufacture, (5) Antiseptic. On heating,
    borax loses water: Na₂B₄O₇·10H₂O → Na₂B₄O₇ + 10H₂O (white powder). Further heating:
    Na₂B₄O₇ → 2NaBO₂ + B₂O₃ (transparent glassy bead used in bead tests).'
