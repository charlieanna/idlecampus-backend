  question: 'For f(x) = x³ - 3x² + 4, find the critical points.'
  options:
  - x = 0 and x = 2
  - x = 1 and x = 3
  - x = -1 and x = 1
  - x = 2 only
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: x = 0 and x = 2
  explanation: 'Critical points occur where f''(x) = 0 or f''(x) is undefined. For
    f(x) = x³ - 3x² + 4: f''(x) = 3x² - 6x = 3x(x - 2). Setting f''(x) = 0: 3x(x
    - 2) = 0, giving x = 0 or x = 2. To classify these critical points, use the second
    derivative test: f''''(x) = 6x - 6. At x = 0: f''''(0) = -6 < 0, so x = 0 is
    a local maximum. At x = 2: f''''(2) = 6 > 0, so x = 2 is a local minimum. The
    function values are: f(0) = 0³ - 3(0)² + 4 = 4 (local max), f(2) = 2³ - 3(2)²
    + 4 = 8 - 12 + 4 = 0 (local min). Critical points are essential for sketching
    curves, optimization problems, and understanding function behavior.'

  question: 'If f''(c) = 0 and f''''(c) > 0, what can we conclude about x = c?'
  options:
  - x = c is a local maximum
  - x = c is a local minimum
  - x = c is an inflection point
  - Cannot determine without more information
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: x = c is a local minimum
  explanation: 'The **second derivative test** states: If f''(c) = 0 and f''''(c)
    > 0, then x = c is a **local minimum**. If f''(c) = 0 and f''''(c) < 0, then
    x = c is a **local maximum**. If f''(c) = 0 and f''''(c) = 0, the test is inconclusive
    (need higher derivatives or first derivative test). **Intuition**: f''''(c) >
    0 means the function is concave up at x = c (curves upward like ∪), so it''s
    a valley (minimum). f''''(c) < 0 means concave down (curves downward like ∩),
    so it''s a peak (maximum). **First derivative test** (alternative): If f''(x)
    changes from negative to positive at x = c, then c is a local min. If f''(x)
    changes from positive to negative at x = c, then c is a local max. **Example**:
    f(x) = x², f''(x) = 2x, f''''(x) = 2. At x = 0: f''(0) = 0 and f''''(0) = 2 >
    0, so x = 0 is a local minimum.'

  question: What is an inflection point?
  options:
  - A point where f''(x) = 0
  - A point where the concavity of the function changes
  - A point where f(x) = 0
  - A point where the function has a local extremum
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: A point where the concavity of the function changes
  explanation: 'An **inflection point** is a point where the **concavity changes**
    - where the function changes from concave up to concave down, or vice versa.
    **Finding inflection points**: (1) Find f''''(x), (2) Solve f''''(x) = 0 or find
    where f''''(x) is undefined, (3) Check if concavity actually changes at these
    points. **Note**: f''''(c) = 0 is necessary but not sufficient for an inflection
    point. Must verify concavity change. **Example**: f(x) = x³, f''(x) = 3x², f''''(x)
    = 6x. f''''(0) = 0, and concavity changes from down (x < 0, f'''' < 0) to up
    (x > 0, f'''' > 0), so x = 0 is an inflection point. **Concavity**: f''''(x)
    > 0 → concave up (∪-shaped), f''''(x) < 0 → concave down (∩-shaped). Inflection
    points are important for curve sketching and understanding function behavior.
    Note: An inflection point is NOT necessarily where f''(x) = 0 (that''s a critical
    point), and NOT necessarily an extremum.'
