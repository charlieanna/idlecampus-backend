  question: 'What effect does adding NaCl to a saturated solution of AgCl have on the solubility of AgCl?'
  options:
  - Increases solubility
  - Decreases solubility
  - No effect on solubility
  - First increases then decreases
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Decreases solubility
  explanation: 'Adding NaCl (source of Cl⁻) to saturated AgCl decreases AgCl solubility due to the common ion effect. AgCl ⇌ Ag⁺ + Cl⁻. When we add NaCl, it provides additional Cl⁻ ions (common ion). By Le Chatelier''s principle, the equilibrium shifts LEFT to consume the added Cl⁻, causing more AgCl to precipitate and reducing solubility. Mathematical explanation: Ksp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = constant. If [Cl⁻] increases from NaCl, then [Ag⁺] must decrease to maintain Ksp constant, meaning less AgCl dissolves. Example: Pure water - AgCl solubility ≈ 1.3 × 10⁻⁵ M; In 0.1 M NaCl - AgCl solubility drops to ~1.8 × 10⁻⁹ M (much less soluble). Applications: (1) Qualitative analysis - using common ions to selectively precipitate salts, (2) Purification - adding common ion to maximize precipitation and remove impurities. The common ion effect ALWAYS decreases solubility.'

  question: 'The ionization of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) is suppressed by adding:'
  options:
  - HCl
  - NaOH
  - CH₃COONa
  - H₂O
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: CH₃COONa
  explanation: 'Adding CH₃COONa (sodium acetate) suppresses ionization of CH₃COOH due to the common ion effect. CH₃COOH ⇌ H⁺ + CH₃COO⁻ (Ka = 1.8 × 10⁻⁵). CH₃COONa completely dissociates: CH₃COONa → Na⁺ + CH₃COO⁻. The added CH₃COO⁻ (common ion) shifts equilibrium LEFT, decreasing ionization of CH₃COOH. Result: (1) Less H⁺ produced, so pH increases, (2) Degree of ionization decreases. Example: 0.1 M CH₃COOH alone ionizes ~1.3%; with 0.1 M CH₃COONa, ionization drops to ~0.018%. Analysis of other options: HCl - adds H⁺, shifts equilibrium left but through different mechanism (not common ion), NaOH - neutralizes the acid completely (different effect), H₂O - dilutes the solution, slightly increases ionization. This common ion effect is the basis of buffer solutions: weak acid + its salt resists pH changes.'

  question: 'Which statement about the common ion effect is FALSE?'
  options:
  - It is an application of Le Chatelier''s principle
  - It decreases the solubility of sparingly soluble salts
  - It increases the degree of ionization of weak acids
  - It is used in qualitative analysis for selective precipitation
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: It increases the degree of ionization of weak acids
  explanation: 'The FALSE statement is "It increases the degree of ionization of weak acids." The common ion effect DECREASES (suppresses) ionization of weak acids, not increases. Correct statements: (1) "Application of Le Chatelier''s principle" - TRUE. Adding a product shifts equilibrium backward, (2) "Decreases solubility of sparingly soluble salts" - TRUE. For AgCl ⇌ Ag⁺ + Cl⁻, adding Cl⁻ shifts left, reducing solubility, (3) "Used in qualitative analysis for selective precipitation" - TRUE. Common ions selectively precipitate certain salts while leaving others in solution. Mechanism: For HA ⇌ H⁺ + A⁻, adding A⁻ (from salt NaA) shifts equilibrium LEFT, reducing [H⁺] and decreasing ionization percentage. Practical applications: (1) Buffer solutions exploit this to resist pH changes, (2) Qualitative analysis uses common ions to separate metal ions, (3) Industrial processes use it to control product purity.'
