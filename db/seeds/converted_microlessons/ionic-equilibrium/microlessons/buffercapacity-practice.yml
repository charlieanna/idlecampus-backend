  Good buffer has: (1) equal [acid]:[salt] ratio for max capacity, (2) high concentrations
  for capacity, (3) operates in pH = pKa ± 1 range. Strong acid/base cannot form buffers.

  question: 'A good buffer solution should have:'
  options:
  - Equal concentrations of weak acid and salt, high total concentration, pH in range
    pKa ± 1
  - Strong acid and strong base in equal amounts
  - Very dilute weak acid and salt
  - Operating at pH = pKa + 3
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Equal concentrations of weak acid and salt, high total concentration,
    pH in range pKa ± 1
  explanation: 'A good buffer solution requires ALL three characteristics: (1) **Equal
    [acid]:[salt] ratio** - Maximum buffer capacity occurs when [HA] = [A⁻], because
    Henderson-Hasselbalch equation pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]) gives pH = pKa when ratio
    is 1:1, (2) **High total concentrations** - More concentrated buffers can neutralize
    more added acid/base before pH changes significantly, (3) **Operating pH in range
    pKa ± 1** - Buffers work effectively only within ~1 pH unit of the pKa value.
    Note: Strong acid/base combinations CANNOT form buffers because they completely
    dissociate and lack the equilibrium needed for buffering. Common buffers: acetic
    acid/acetate (pH ~4.7), NH₃/NH₄⁺ (pH ~9.3).'

  question: 'Which buffer has the HIGHEST buffer capacity: (A) 0.01 M CH₃COOH + 0.01 M CH₃COONa, (B) 0.1 M CH₃COOH + 0.1 M CH₃COONa, or (C) 1 M CH₃COOH + 1 M CH₃COONa?'
  options:
  - Buffer A
  - Buffer B
  - Buffer C
  - All have equal capacity
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Buffer C
  explanation: 'Buffer C (1 M each) has the highest buffer capacity because buffer capacity is directly proportional to concentration. All three buffers have the same pH (pH = pKa = 4.74 since [acid] = [salt]), but differ in capacity to resist pH change. Buffer capacity (β) ∝ total concentration when ratio is 1:1. Quantitative comparison: If 0.01 mol HCl is added to 1 L of each: Buffer A (0.01 M): Buffer exhausted, pH drops dramatically; Buffer B (0.1 M): pH changes by ~0.8 units; Buffer C (1 M): pH changes by only ~0.086 units. The higher concentration buffer can neutralize more added acid/base before significant pH change. Mathematical basis: β = 2.303 × C × Ka × [H⁺]/(Ka + [H⁺])², where C is total concentration. At pH = pKa, buffer capacity is maximum and directly proportional to C. Practical applications: Blood buffers use relatively high concentrations (0.024 M bicarbonate) to maintain pH 7.4 despite metabolic acid production.'

  question: 'At what ratio of [A⁻]/[HA] does a buffer have MAXIMUM capacity to resist pH changes?'
  options:
  - 10:1
  - 5:1
  - 1:1
  - 1:10
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 1:1
  explanation: 'Maximum buffer capacity occurs at ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = 1:1, meaning pH = pKa. Mathematical proof: Buffer capacity β = 2.303 × C × Ka × [H⁺]/(Ka + [H⁺])². This is maximum when [H⁺] = Ka (i.e., pH = pKa), which corresponds to [A⁻] = [HA]. Physical reason: At 1:1 ratio, the buffer has equal amounts of: (1) Weak acid (HA) to neutralize added base (OH⁻), (2) Conjugate base (A⁻) to neutralize added acid (H⁺). This balanced state provides optimal resistance to pH change in both directions. When ratio deviates from 1:1: At 10:1 (pH = pKa + 1): Buffer can handle much base but limited acid; At 1:10 (pH = pKa - 1): Buffer can handle much acid but limited base. Effective buffer range: 0.1 < [A⁻]/[HA] < 10, or pKa - 1 < pH < pKa + 1. Outside this range, buffer capacity drops significantly. This is why we choose buffers with pKa close to desired pH (ideally pKa = target pH).'
