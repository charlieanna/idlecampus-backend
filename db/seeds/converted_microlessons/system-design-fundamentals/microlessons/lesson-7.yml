  \ **CAP theorem** states that a distributed system can only guarantee **two out\
  \ of three** properties:\n\n    ## The Three Properties\n\n    ### C = Consistency\n\
  \    **All nodes see the same data at the same time**\n\n    ```\n    User writes:\
  \ balance = $100\n    User reads from ANY node: balance = $100\n    ```\n\n    Every\
  \ read receives the most recent write.\n\n    ### A = Availability\n    **Every\
  \ request receives a response (success or failure)**\n\n    ```\n    User makes\
  \ request → Always gets a response\n    (Even if some nodes are down)\n    ```\n\
  \n    System continues to operate despite failures.\n\n    ### P = Partition Tolerance\n\
  \    **System continues despite network partitions**\n\n    ```\n    Network split:\
  \ [Node1, Node2] | [Node3, Node4]\n    System still operates on both sides\n   \
  \ ```\n\n    System handles arbitrary network failures.\n\n    ## Why You Can't\
  \ Have All Three\n\n    **During a network partition, you must choose:**\n\n   \
  \ ### CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)\n    **Sacrifice Availability**\n\n\
  \    ```\n    Network partition detected\n    → Reject writes until partition heals\n\
  \    → Ensures all nodes have consistent data\n    → But some requests fail (unavailable)\n\
  \    ```\n\n    **Examples:** Banking systems, inventory management\n\n    ### AP\
  \ (Availability + Partition Tolerance)\n    **Sacrifice Consistency**\n\n    ```\n\
  \    Network partition detected\n    → Accept writes on both sides\n    → All requests\
  \ succeed (available)\n    → But data may diverge (inconsistent)\n    → Reconcile\
  \ conflicts later\n    ```\n\n    **Examples:** Social media feeds, DNS, shopping\
  \ carts\n\n    ### CA (Consistency + Availability)\n    **Not possible in distributed\
  \ systems!**\n\n    Network partitions will happen, so you must be partition tolerant.\n\
  \n    ## Real-World Systems\n\n    ### CP Systems\n\n    **MongoDB (with default\
  \ settings)**\n    ```javascript\n    // Write with majority concern\n    db.users.insert(\n\
  \      { name: \"Alice\", balance: 100 },\n      { writeConcern: { w: \"majority\"\
  \ } }\n    );\n    // Blocks until majority of replicas confirm\n    // If partition:\
  \ write fails (CP)\n    ```\n\n    **HBase, Redis Cluster**\n\n    **When to use:**\n\
  \    - Financial transactions\n    - Inventory management\n    - Ticket booking\n\
  \    - Seat reservations\n\n    ### AP Systems\n\n    **Cassandra**\n    ```sql\n\
  \    -- Write with eventual consistency\n    INSERT INTO users (id, name, balance)\n\
  \    VALUES (1, 'Alice', 100);\n    -- Returns immediately, replicates async\n \
  \   -- If partition: writes succeed on available nodes (AP)\n    ```\n\n    **DynamoDB,\
  \ Riak, CouchDB**\n\n    **When to use:**\n    - Social media feeds\n    - Analytics\n\
  \    - Logging\n    - Shopping carts\n    - DNS\n\n    ## Consistency Models\n\n\
  \    ### 1. Strong Consistency\n    **All nodes show same data at same time**\n\n\
  \    ```python\n    # Write\n    db.write('key', 'value1')\n\n    # Immediate read\
  \ from ANY node\n    db.read('key')  # Always returns 'value1'\n    ```\n\n    ✅\
  \ Simple to reason about\n    ❌ Higher latency, lower availability\n\n    ### 2.\
  \ Eventual Consistency\n    **All nodes will eventually have same data**\n\n   \
  \ ```python\n    # Write to Node1\n    node1.write('key', 'value1')\n\n    # Read\
  \ from Node2 (immediately)\n    node2.read('key')  # Might return old value or 'value1'\n\
  \n    # Read from Node2 (after propagation)\n    time.sleep(0.1)\n    node2.read('key')\
  \  # Returns 'value1'\n    ```\n\n    ✅ Lower latency, higher availability\n   \
  \ ❌ Temporary inconsistencies\n\n    **Real example: Facebook**\n    ```\n    User\
  \ posts status update\n    → Writes to primary datacenter\n    → Eventually propagates\
  \ to global replicas\n    → Different users might see update at different times\n\
  \    ```\n\n    ### 3. Causal Consistency\n    **Causally related operations are\
  \ seen in order**\n\n    ```python\n    # User A posts comment\n    post_comment(\"\
  Great post!\")  # Event 1\n\n    # User B replies to comment\n    reply_comment(\"\
  Thanks!\")     # Event 2 (depends on Event 1)\n\n    # All users see Event 1 before\
  \ Event 2\n    # But unrelated events may appear in any order\n    ```\n\n    ###\
  \ 4. Read-After-Write Consistency\n    **User sees their own writes immediately**\n\
  \n    ```python\n    # User updates profile\n    user.update(name=\"Alice\")\n\n\
  \    # User immediately views profile\n    user.get()  # Guaranteed to see \"Alice\"\
  \n\n    # Other users may see old value temporarily\n    ```\n\n    ## Quorum Reads\
  \ and Writes\n\n    **Ensure consistency by reading/writing to majority of nodes**\n\
  \n    ### Configuration\n\n    ```\n    N = Total replicas (e.g., 5)\n    W = Write\
  \ quorum (e.g., 3)\n    R = Read quorum (e.g., 3)\n    ```\n\n    **Strong consistency\
  \ when: W + R > N**\n\n    ```\n    N = 5 replicas\n    W = 3 (write to 3 nodes)\n\
  \    R = 3 (read from 3 nodes)\n    W + R = 6 > N = 5 ✓\n\n    Guaranteed to read\
  \ at least one node with latest write!\n    ```\n\n    ### Example: Cassandra\n\n\
  \    ```sql\n    -- Write with quorum\n    INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (1,\
  \ 'Alice')\n    USING CONSISTENCY QUORUM;\n\n    -- Read with quorum\n    SELECT\
  \ * FROM users WHERE id = 1\n    USING CONSISTENCY QUORUM;\n    ```\n\n    **Tradeoffs:**\n\
  \n    | Configuration | Consistency | Availability | Latency |\n    |--------------|-------------|--------------|---------|\n\
  \    | W=1, R=1 | Weak | High | Low |\n    | W=QUORUM, R=QUORUM | Strong | Medium\
  \ | Medium |\n    | W=ALL, R=1 | Strong reads | Low writes | High writes |\n\n \
  \   ## Conflict Resolution\n\n    ### Last Write Wins (LWW)\n\n    ```python\n \
  \   # Conflict: Two writes to same key\n    Node1: write('user:1:name', 'Alice',\
  \ timestamp=100)\n    Node2: write('user:1:name', 'Alicia', timestamp=101)\n\n \
  \   # Resolution: Keep latest timestamp\n    Final value: 'Alicia' (timestamp 101)\n\
  \    ```\n\n    ❌ **Problem:** Clock skew can cause issues\n    ✅ **Simple and predictable**\n\
  \n    ### Vector Clocks\n\n    ```python\n    # Track causality with vector clocks\n\
  \    Version 1: {server1: 1, server2: 0} → name=\"Alice\"\n    Version 2: {server1:\
  \ 1, server2: 1} → name=\"Alicia\"\n\n    # Version 2 happened after Version 1 (causally)\n\
  \    # Keep Version 2\n    ```\n\n    ### Application-Level Resolution\n\n    ```python\n\
  \    # Shopping cart example\n    User adds from Node1: cart = [item1, item2]\n\
  \    User adds from Node2: cart = [item3]\n\n    # Conflict!\n    # Resolution:\
  \ Merge carts\n    Final cart = [item1, item2, item3]\n    ```\n\n    ## ACID vs\
  \ BASE\n\n    ### ACID (Traditional Databases)\n\n    - **Atomicity**: All or nothing\n\
  \    - **Consistency**: Valid state always\n    - **Isolation**: Transactions don't\
  \ interfere\n    - **Durability**: Committed data persists\n\n    ```sql\n    BEGIN\
  \ TRANSACTION;\n    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;\n\
  \    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;\n    COMMIT;  --\
  \ Both updates or neither\n    ```\n\n    ### BASE (Distributed Systems)\n\n   \
  \ - **Basically Available**: System available most of the time\n    - **Soft state**:\
  \ State may change over time (eventual consistency)\n    - **Eventually consistent**:\
  \ Will become consistent given enough time\n\n    ```python\n    # BASE example:\
  \ Shopping cart\n    add_to_cart(user_id, item)  # Succeeds immediately\n    # Cart\
  \ replicated eventually to all nodes\n    # Conflicts merged later\n    ```\n\n\
  \    ## Practical Decisions\n\n    ### E-commerce System\n\n    **Product Catalog\
  \ (AP)**\n    ```\n    - Eventual consistency OK\n    - Availability critical (can't\
  \ lose sales)\n    - Temporary stale data acceptable\n    → Use Cassandra or DynamoDB\n\
  \    ```\n\n    **Inventory (CP)**\n    ```\n    - Strong consistency required\n\
  \    - Can't oversell items\n    - Brief unavailability acceptable\n    → Use relational\
  \ DB with proper locking\n    ```\n\n    **Shopping Cart (AP)**\n    ```\n    -\
  \ Eventual consistency OK\n    - Must remain available\n    - Merge conflicts (combine\
  \ items)\n    → Use DynamoDB or Cassandra\n    ```\n\n    **Orders/Payments (CP)**\n\
  \    ```\n    - Strong consistency critical\n    - No duplicate charges\n    - ACID\
  \ transactions needed\n    → Use PostgreSQL or MySQL\n    ```\n\n    ## Best Practices\n\
  \n    1. **Choose based on business requirements**\n       - Critical data = CP\
  \ (consistency)\n       - User-facing = AP (availability)\n\n    2. **Hybrid approach**\n\
  \       - Different subsystems can make different tradeoffs\n       - Use both CP\
  \ and AP systems\n\n    3. **Design for partition tolerance**\n       - Network\
  \ failures will happen\n       - Plan for split-brain scenarios\n\n    4. **Monitor\
  \ and measure**\n       - Track consistency lag\n       - Measure availability SLAs\n\
  \n    **Next**: We'll explore load balancing strategies and patterns."

    question: "What is a CDN (Content Delivery Network) and how does it improve performance?"
    options:
      - "A type of database"
      - "A network of distributed servers that cache content closer to users to reduce latency"
      - "A load balancing algorithm"
      - "A programming framework"
    correct_answer: "A network of distributed servers that cache content closer to users to reduce latency"
    explanation: "A CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that cache static content (images, videos, CSS, JS) close to users. When a user in Tokyo requests a file, they get it from a Tokyo CDN server, not the origin server in California. Benefits: reduced latency (shorter physical distance), lower bandwidth costs, improved availability, and DDoS protection. How it works: (1) User requests content, (2) DNS routes to nearest CDN server, (3) CDN serves cached content or fetches from origin, (4) CDN caches for future requests. Examples: Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, Akamai. Essential for global applications, video streaming, and high-traffic websites."

    question: "What is the purpose of database indexing?"
    options:
      - "To backup the database"
      - "To speed up data retrieval operations by creating a data structure that improves search performance"
      - "To compress data"
      - "To encrypt sensitive data"
    correct_answer: "To speed up data retrieval operations by creating a data structure that improves search performance"
    explanation: "Database indexes are data structures (typically B-trees or hash tables) that improve query speed. Like a book index, they help quickly locate data without scanning every row. Trade-off: faster reads, slower writes (indexes must be updated). Example: Without index on email column, finding user by email requires full table scan (O(n)). With index: O(log n) lookup. When to index: frequently queried columns, foreign keys, columns in WHERE/ORDER BY clauses. Don't over-index: each index adds storage and slows writes. Most databases automatically index primary keys. Strategic indexing is crucial for performance at scale."
