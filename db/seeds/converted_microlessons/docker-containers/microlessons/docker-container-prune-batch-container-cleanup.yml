  \ docker container prune: Efficient Container Cleanup\n\n    ## What is docker container\
  \ prune?\n    `docker container prune` removes all stopped containers in a single\
  \ command. It's the modern, efficient way to clean up your Docker environment without\
  \ manually removing containers one by one.\n\n    ## Why Batch Cleanup Matters\n\
  \    - **Efficiency**: Clean dozens of containers with one command\n    - **Disk\
  \ Space**: Reclaim significant storage quickly\n    - **Automation**: Perfect for\
  \ CI/CD cleanup scripts\n    - **Safety**: Only removes stopped containers (running\
  \ ones are protected)\n\n    ## Common Use Cases\n\n    ### Remove All Stopped Containers\n\
  \    ```bash\n    docker container prune -f\n    ```\n\n    ### Filter by Time\n\
  \    ```bash\n    docker container prune --filter \"until=24h\"\n    ```\n\n   \
  \ ### Safety Features\n    The command prompts for confirmation unless you use `-f`\
  \ flag.\n\n    ## Best Practices\n    1. Schedule regular cleanup via cron\n   \
  \ 2. Use filters wisely\n    3. Label containers for selective cleanup\n    4. Test\
  \ in dev first\n\n## Syntax/Command\n\n```bash\ndocker container prune\n```\n\n\
  ## Example\n\n```bash\ndocker container prune -f\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Basic\
  \ prune: docker container prune (with confirmation)\n\n- Force prune: docker container\
  \ prune -f\n\n- Age filter: docker container prune --filter \"until=24h\""

  question: What does docker container prune remove by default?
  options:
  - All stopped containers only, running containers are protected
  - All containers including running ones
  - All containers and all images
  - Only containers older than 24 hours
  correct_answer: All stopped containers only, running containers are protected
  explanation: "docker container prune removes only stopped containers by default, protecting running containers from accidental deletion. Use -f to skip the confirmation prompt."
