content_md: '# Docker Stats: Live Resource Usage Statistics 🚀


  Display live resource usage statistics including CPU, memory, network I/O, and disk
  I/O for running containers.


  ## Syntax/Command


  ```bash

  docker stats

  ```


  ## Example


  ```bash

  docker stats --no-stream

  ```


  ## Key Points


  - Live stats: docker stats


  - One-shot: docker stats --no-stream


  - Specific containers: docker stats web db'
exercises:
- type: terminal
  problem_statement: Display live resource usage statistics for all running containers
  expected_output: Real-time table showing CPU%, MEM USAGE, NET I/O, BLOCK I/O for each container
  language: bash

  question: What does a CPU percentage of 200% mean in docker stats?
  options:
  - Container is using 2 full CPU cores worth of processing power
  - Container is overloaded by 100% and needs more resources
  - There is an error in the measurement system
  - CPU limit has been exceeded and container will be throttled
  correct_answer: Container is using 2 full CPU cores worth of processing power
  explanation: "CPU percentage in docker stats can exceed 100% because it represents total CPU usage across all cores. 200% means the container is using the equivalent of 2 full CPU cores. On a 4-core system, 400% would be the maximum."
  require_pass: true
