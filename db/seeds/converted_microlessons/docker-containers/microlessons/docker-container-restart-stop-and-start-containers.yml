  question: What does docker restart do?
  options:
  - Stops then starts the container - equivalent to stop followed by start
  - Only stops the container without restarting
  - Reloads configuration without stopping the container
  - Creates a new container from the same image
  correct_answer: Stops then starts the container - equivalent to stop followed by start
  explanation: "docker container restart performs a graceful stop (SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL if needed) and then starts the container again. It's useful for applying configuration changes or resolving temporary issues."
