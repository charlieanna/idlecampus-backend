content_md: '# Docker Diff: Inspect Container Filesystem Changes 🚀


  Show which files and directories have been modified, added, or deleted in a container
  compared to its base image.


  ## Syntax/Command


  ```bash

  docker diff my-container

  ```


  ## Example


  ```bash

  docker diff container

  ```


  ## Key Points


  - See all changes: docker diff <container>


  - Only added files: docker diff <container> | grep "^A"


  - Only modified: docker diff <container> | grep "^C"'
exercises:
- type: terminal
  problem_statement: Inspect filesystem changes in a container named 'my-container' to see what files have been modified, added, or deleted
  expected_output: List of filesystem changes with prefixes A (added), C (changed), D (deleted)
  language: bash

  question: In docker diff output, what does the "C" prefix indicate?
  options:
  - A file or directory that has been changed (modified) since the container was created
  - A file that has been completely deleted from the container
  - A new file that was added to the container
  - A file that is currently being accessed by a process
  correct_answer: A file or directory that has been changed (modified) since the container was created
  explanation: "In docker diff output, the prefix 'C' indicates a changed (modified) file or directory. 'A' indicates added files, and 'D' indicates deleted files. This is useful for debugging, security audits, and understanding what changed in a running container."
