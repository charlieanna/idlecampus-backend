content_md: '# Docker Port: List Port Mappings 🚀


  Display port mappings for a container showing how container ports are exposed on
  the host.


  ## Syntax/Command


  ```bash

  docker port my-container

  ```


  ## Example


  ```bash

  docker port container

  ```


  ## Key Points


  - All mappings: docker port <container>


  - Specific port: docker port <container> 80'
exercises:
- type: terminal
  problem_statement: List all port mappings for a container named 'my-container'
  expected_output: List showing container ports mapped to host ports (e.g., 80/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:8080)
  language: bash

  question: What information does docker port provide?
  options:
  - Port mappings showing which container ports are exposed on which host ports
  - List of all open ports inside the container
  - Complete network configuration of the container
  - Firewall rules applied to the container
  correct_answer: Port mappings showing which container ports are exposed on which host ports
  explanation: "docker port displays the mapping between container ports and host ports, showing how you can access services running inside the container from the host machine (e.g., container port 80 mapped to host port 8080)."
