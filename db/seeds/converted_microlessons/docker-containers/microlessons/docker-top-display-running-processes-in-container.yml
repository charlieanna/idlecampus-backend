content_md: '# Docker Top: Display Running Processes in Container 🚀


  Display running processes inside a container, similar to the Unix top command but
  for containerized processes.


  ## Syntax/Command


  ```bash

  docker top my-container

  ```


  ## Example


  ```bash

  docker top container

  ```


  ## Key Points


  - View processes: docker top <container>


  - With ps options: docker top <container> aux'
exercises:
- type: terminal
  problem_statement: Display all running processes inside a container named 'my-container'
  expected_output: Table showing PID, USER, TIME, COMMAND for processes in the container
  language: bash
  starter_code: "# View container processes\n"
  sequence_order: 1
  command: docker top my-container
  description: List all processes running in a container to identify resource hogs
  hints:
  - 'View processes: docker top <container>'
  - 'With ps options: docker top <container> aux'

  question: What does docker top display?
  options:
  - Running processes inside the specified container, similar to Unix 'ps' command
  - The containers using the most resources on the system
  - Complete container configuration and metadata
  - Recent log entries from the container
  correct_answer: Running processes inside the specified container, similar to Unix 'ps' command
  explanation: "docker top shows the running processes inside a container, displaying information like PID, USER, TIME, and COMMAND. It's similar to running 'ps' inside the container without needing to exec into it."
  require_pass: true
