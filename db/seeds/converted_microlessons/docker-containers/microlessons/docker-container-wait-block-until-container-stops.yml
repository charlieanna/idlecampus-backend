  question: What does docker wait return?
  options:
  - The exit code of the container after it stops
  - The container ID of the stopped container
  - The container's process ID (PID)
  - The timestamp when the container stopped
  correct_answer: The exit code of the container after it stops
  explanation: "docker container wait blocks until the specified container stops and then returns its exit code. This is useful in scripts where you need to wait for a container to finish and check if it succeeded (exit code 0) or failed (non-zero exit code)."
