content_md: '# Docker CP: Copy Files Between Container and Host 🚀


  Copy files and directories bidirectionally between containers and host filesystem,
  even while containers are running.


  ## Syntax/Command


  ```bash

  docker cp my-file.txt my-container:/app/

  ```


  ## Example


  ```bash

  docker cp host-file.txt container:/path/

  ```


  ## Key Points


  - Host to container: docker cp /local/file container:/remote/


  - Container to host: docker cp container:/remote/file /local/'
exercises:
- type: terminal
  problem_statement: Copy a file named 'my-file.txt' from the host to the /app/ directory inside a container named 'my-container'
  expected_output: Silent success (no output on success)
  language: bash
  starter_code: "# Copy file from host to container\n"

  question: Can you use docker cp on a stopped container?
  options:
  - Yes, docker cp works on both running and stopped containers
  - No, the container must be running first
  - Only for copying files FROM the container to host
  - Only if you use the --force flag
  correct_answer: Yes, docker cp works on both running and stopped containers
  explanation: "docker cp works on both running and stopped containers. You can copy files to or from a container regardless of its state, making it useful for extracting data from stopped containers or preparing containers before they start."
