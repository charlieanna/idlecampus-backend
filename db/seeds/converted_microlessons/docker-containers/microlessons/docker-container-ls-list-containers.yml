  question: What is the difference between "docker container ls" and "docker ps"?
  options:
  - They are equivalent commands with same functionality
  - docker container ls shows more details than docker ps
  - docker ps only shows running containers while ls shows all
  - docker container ls is deprecated in favor of docker ps
  correct_answer: They are equivalent commands with same functionality
  explanation: "docker container ls and docker ps are aliases - they perform identical operations. docker container ls is the newer syntax following Docker's command structure pattern, but docker ps remains supported for backward compatibility."
