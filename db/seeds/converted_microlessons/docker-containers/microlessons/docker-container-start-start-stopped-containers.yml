  question: What happens to container data when you start a stopped container?
  options:
  - Data is preserved from when it was stopped - the container resumes with the same state
  - Container starts fresh with no data from previous run
  - Data is preserved but all running processes are restarted
  - Only volumes are preserved, filesystem changes are lost
  correct_answer: Data is preserved from when it was stopped - the container resumes with the same state
  explanation: "When you stop and then start a container, its filesystem state is preserved exactly as it was when stopped. This is different from removing and recreating a container, which would lose all changes."
