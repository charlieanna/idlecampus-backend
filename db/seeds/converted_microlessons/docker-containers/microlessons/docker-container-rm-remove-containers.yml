  question: Can you remove a running container without -f flag?
  options:
  - No, you must stop the container first or use -f to force removal
  - Yes, docker rm works on running containers by default
  - Only if the container has no volumes attached
  - Only if you have root privileges
  correct_answer: No, you must stop the container first or use -f to force removal
  explanation: "docker container rm requires the container to be stopped first. Attempting to remove a running container will fail unless you use the -f (--force) flag, which forcefully stops and removes it."
  require_pass: true
