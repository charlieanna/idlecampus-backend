  Create a tarball archive of a container\


  ## Syntax/Command


  ```bash

  docker export my-container > backup.tar

  ```


  ## Example


  ```bash

  docker export -o backup.tar my-container

  ```


  ## Key Points


  - Basic export: docker export container > file.tar


  - Compressed: docker export container | gzip > file.tar.gz


  - Import back: cat file.tar | docker import - image:tag'
exercises:
- type: terminal
  problem_statement: Export the filesystem of a container named 'my-container' to a tar archive file named 'backup.tar'
  expected_output: Tar archive file created with container's filesystem contents

  question: What is the main difference between docker export and docker save?
  options:
  - export creates a flattened archive of a container's filesystem, while save preserves image layers and metadata
  - export is for images while save is for containers
  - export includes all metadata while save does not
  - They are exactly the same command with different names
  correct_answer: export creates a flattened archive of a container's filesystem, while save preserves image layers and metadata
  explanation: "docker export creates a tar archive of a container's entire filesystem as a flat structure, losing layer information. docker save exports an image with all its layers and metadata preserved. Use export for migrating container filesystems, and save for backing up images."
