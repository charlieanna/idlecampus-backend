  Iodoform test (I₂/NaOH) is positive for methyl ketones (CH₃CO-R) and compounds giving
  CH₃CO- on oxidation (CH₃CHO, CH₃CH₂OH). Yellow ppt of CHI₃ forms.

  question: 'Iodoform test is positive for:'
  options:
  - Methyl ketones (CH₃CO-R) and compounds giving CH₃CO- on oxidation
  - All aldehydes and ketones
  - Only aromatic ketones
  - Primary alcohols only
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Methyl ketones (CH₃CO-R) and compounds giving CH₃CO- on oxidation
  explanation: 'The iodoform test (I₂/NaOH) is positive for methyl ketones (compounds with CH₃-CO-R structure) and compounds that can be oxidized to give this structure. When treated with iodine and sodium hydroxide, these compounds form a yellow precipitate of iodoform (CHI₃). Compounds giving positive iodoform test include: (1) Methyl ketones like acetone (CH₃COCH₃), (2) Acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO), (3) Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH), and (4) Secondary alcohols with CH₃CH(OH)- structure. Ethanol and acetaldehyde are oxidized to CH₃CO- under test conditions. The test is specific for the CH₃CO- group or structures that can generate it.'

  question: 'Which of these compounds will NOT give a positive iodoform test?'
  options:
  - Acetone (CH₃COCH₃)
  - Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH)
  - Propanone
  - Benzaldehyde (C₆H₅CHO)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Benzaldehyde (C₆H₅CHO)
  explanation: 'Benzaldehyde (C₆H₅CHO) will NOT give a positive iodoform test because it does not contain the CH₃CO- group and cannot be oxidized to form one. The iodoform test requires either a methyl ketone structure (CH₃CO-R) or a compound that can be oxidized to this structure. Acetone (CH₃COCH₃) is a methyl ketone and gives positive test. Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) can be oxidized to acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO), which then gives positive test. Propanone is another name for acetone, so it also gives positive test. Benzaldehyde has a phenyl group (C₆H₅-) instead of methyl group attached to the carbonyl, so it fails to give iodoform.'

  question: 'What is the yellow precipitate formed in a positive iodoform test?'
  options:
  - Iodine (I₂)
  - Sodium iodide (NaI)
  - Iodoform (CHI₃)
  - Triiodoethane
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Iodoform (CHI₃)
  explanation: 'The yellow precipitate formed in a positive iodoform test is iodoform (CHI₃), also called triiodomethane. When a methyl ketone reacts with I₂/NaOH, the three hydrogens of the methyl group (CH₃-) are successively replaced by iodine atoms to form CI₃ group. This CI₃ group is then cleaved off by the base to form CHI₃ (iodoform), which precipitates as bright yellow crystals with a characteristic antiseptic smell. The reaction is: R-CO-CH₃ + 3I₂ + 4NaOH → R-COONa + CHI₃↓ + 3NaI + 3H₂O. The formation of yellow CHI₃ precipitate is diagnostic for this test.'
