  Cannizzaro: Aldehydes WITHOUT α-H undergo disproportionation. HCHO, C₆H₅CHO, (CH₃)₃C-CHO
  give Cannizzaro. One molecule → alcohol, one → acid.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'Cannizzaro reaction is given by:'
  options:
  - Aldehydes with α-hydrogen
  - Aldehydes without α-hydrogen
  - All ketones
  - Carboxylic acids
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Aldehydes without α-hydrogen
  explanation: 'The Cannizzaro reaction is a disproportionation reaction that occurs
    only with aldehydes that lack α-hydrogen atoms (no hydrogen on the carbon adjacent
    to carbonyl). When such aldehydes are treated with concentrated base (NaOH or
    KOH), one molecule is oxidized to carboxylic acid/salt and another is reduced
    to alcohol. Examples: formaldehyde (HCHO), benzaldehyde (C₆H₅CHO), and trimethylacetaldehyde
    ((CH₃)₃C-CHO) undergo Cannizzaro reaction because they have no α-H. Aldehydes
    with α-hydrogen prefer aldol condensation instead. The mechanism involves nucleophilic
    attack by OH⁻, followed by hydride transfer from one aldehyde molecule to another.'

  question: 'Which aldehyde will NOT undergo Cannizzaro reaction?'
  options:
  - Formaldehyde (HCHO)
  - Benzaldehyde (C₆H₅CHO)
  - Acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO)
  - Trimethylacetaldehyde ((CH₃)₃C-CHO)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO)
  explanation: 'Acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO) will NOT undergo Cannizzaro reaction because it has α-hydrogen atoms (the three H atoms on the CH₃ group adjacent to carbonyl). Aldehydes with α-hydrogen undergo aldol condensation instead of Cannizzaro when treated with base. The other three aldehydes lack α-hydrogen: formaldehyde (HCHO) has no carbon adjacent to carbonyl, benzaldehyde (C₆H₅CHO) has a phenyl group with no α-H, and trimethylacetaldehyde ((CH₃)₃C-CHO) has a quaternary carbon with no H atoms. All three undergo Cannizzaro reaction, giving one molecule of alcohol and one of carboxylic acid/salt.'

  question: 'In Cannizzaro reaction, what happens to the two aldehyde molecules?'
  options:
  - Both are oxidized
  - Both are reduced
  - One is oxidized to acid, one is reduced to alcohol
  - Both form ketones
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: One is oxidized to acid, one is reduced to alcohol
  explanation: 'In Cannizzaro reaction, one aldehyde molecule is oxidized to carboxylic acid (or its salt) and another aldehyde molecule is reduced to alcohol. This is called disproportionation - a redox reaction where the same compound acts as both oxidizing and reducing agent. For example, with benzaldehyde: 2C₆H₅CHO + NaOH → C₆H₅CH₂OH (benzyl alcohol) + C₆H₅COONa (sodium benzoate). The mechanism involves hydride (H⁻) transfer from one aldehyde to another. The aldehyde donating H⁻ gets oxidized (loses H, gains O oxidation state), while the aldehyde receiving H⁻ gets reduced (gains H). This simultaneous oxidation-reduction of the same compound is characteristic of Cannizzaro reaction.'
