  2CH₃CHO → [Base] → CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CHO (aldol) → [heat, -H₂O] → CH₃CH=CHCHO (crotonaldehyde,
  α,β-unsaturated aldehyde). Without heat, product is β-hydroxy aldehyde.

  question: 'What is the product when aldol condensation of acetaldehyde is carried out with heat?'
  options:
  - Aldol (β-hydroxy aldehyde)
  - Crotonaldehyde (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde)
  - Acetone
  - Acetic acid
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Crotonaldehyde (α,β-unsaturated aldehyde)
  explanation: 'When aldol condensation of acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO) is carried out with base and heat, the final product is crotonaldehyde (CH₃CH=CHCHO), an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. The reaction occurs in two steps: (1) First, aldol condensation forms the β-hydroxy aldehyde (CH₃CH(OH)CH₂CHO) called aldol. (2) Upon heating, dehydration (-H₂O) occurs to form the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde crotonaldehyde. Without heat, the reaction stops at the aldol stage (β-hydroxy aldehyde). The heat drives the elimination of water, creating a conjugated C=C-C=O system.'

  question: 'Which structural feature is required for a carbonyl compound to undergo aldol condensation?'
  options:
  - Must be aromatic
  - Must have α-hydrogen
  - Must be a ketone only
  - Must have β-hydrogen
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Must have α-hydrogen
  explanation: 'For a carbonyl compound to undergo aldol condensation, it must have at least one α-hydrogen (hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to carbonyl group). This is essential because the base abstracts the α-hydrogen to form an enolate ion, which acts as a nucleophile and attacks another carbonyl molecule. Compounds without α-hydrogen (like benzaldehyde, formaldehyde, or trimethylacetaldehyde) cannot form enolates and therefore undergo other reactions like Cannizzaro instead. Both aldehydes and ketones with α-hydrogen can undergo aldol condensation, though aldehydes are more reactive.'

  question: 'What is the intermediate species formed when base abstracts α-hydrogen from acetaldehyde in aldol reaction?'
  options:
  - Carbanion
  - Enolate ion
  - Carbocation
  - Free radical
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Enolate ion
  explanation: 'When base (OH⁻ or other strong base) abstracts an α-hydrogen from acetaldehyde, it forms an enolate ion. The enolate ion is a resonance-stabilized species where the negative charge is delocalized between the α-carbon and the oxygen of the carbonyl group. This can be represented as CH₂=CH-O⁻ ↔ ⁻CH₂-CH=O. The enolate ion is a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of another acetaldehyde molecule, leading to carbon-carbon bond formation. The resonance stabilization makes the enolate relatively stable despite being a reactive intermediate, which is crucial for the aldol condensation mechanism.'
