  Friedel-Crafts acylation: C₆H₆ + CH₃COCl → [AlCl₃] → C₆H₅COCH₃ (Acetophenone/Phenylethanone)
  + HCl. Best method for aromatic ketones.


  ## Key Points

  question: 'Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with CH₃COCl gives:'
  options:
  - Benzaldehyde
  - Acetophenone
  - Benzophenone
  - Benzoic acid
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Acetophenone
  explanation: 'Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with acetyl chloride (CH₃COCl)
    in presence of anhydrous AlCl₃ catalyst gives acetophenone (C₆H₅-CO-CH₃), also
    called phenyl methyl ketone or phenylethanone. The reaction is: C₆H₆ + CH₃COCl
    → [AlCl₃] → C₆H₅-CO-CH₃ + HCl. This is the best and most important method for
    preparing aromatic ketones. The mechanism involves formation of acylium ion (CH₃-CO⁺)
    from acyl chloride and AlCl₃, which then attacks the benzene ring in an electrophilic
    aromatic substitution. Unlike Friedel-Crafts alkylation, acylation does not undergo
    rearrangement and stops after one substitution because the ketone product deactivates
    the ring.'

  question: 'Why does Friedel-Crafts acylation stop after one substitution?'
  options:
  - The ketone product deactivates the benzene ring
  - AlCl₃ catalyst gets consumed
  - Acyl chloride is used up
  - Temperature becomes too high
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: The ketone product deactivates the benzene ring
  explanation: 'Friedel-Crafts acylation stops after one substitution because the ketone product (ArCOCH₃) deactivates the benzene ring toward further electrophilic substitution. The carbonyl group (-CO-) is electron-withdrawing due to its -I (negative inductive) and -R (negative resonance) effects, which decrease electron density in the ring. This makes the ring less nucleophilic and resistant to further acylation. This is a major advantage over Friedel-Crafts alkylation, where the alkyl product activates the ring (+I effect), leading to polyalkylation. Additionally, the ketone oxygen coordinates with AlCl₃ catalyst, reducing its availability. This self-limiting nature makes acylation more controllable and selective than alkylation.'

  question: 'What is the key intermediate in Friedel-Crafts acylation mechanism?'
  options:
  - Acylium ion (R-CO⁺)
  - Carbocation (R⁺)
  - Free radical (R•)
  - Carbanion (R⁻)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Acylium ion (R-CO⁺)
  explanation: 'The key intermediate in Friedel-Crafts acylation is the acylium ion (R-CO⁺), also called acyl cation. It is formed when the acyl chloride (R-COCl) reacts with Lewis acid AlCl₃: R-COCl + AlCl₃ → [R-CO⁺][AlCl₄⁻]. The acylium ion is resonance stabilized: R-C≡O⁺ ↔ R-C⁺=O, making it relatively stable. This positively charged electrophile then attacks the electron-rich benzene ring in electrophilic aromatic substitution. The acylium ion is more stable and less prone to rearrangement than carbocations formed in Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which is why acylation gives more predictable products without skeletal rearrangements.'
