  question: 'Why are aldehydes generally more reactive than ketones in nucleophilic addition reactions?'
  options:
  - Aldehydes have both electronic and steric advantages over ketones
  - Aldehydes have higher boiling points than ketones
  - Aldehydes are more polar than ketones
  - Aldehydes can form hydrogen bonds while ketones cannot
  correct_answer: Aldehydes have both electronic and steric advantages over ketones
  explanation: "Aldehydes are significantly more reactive than ketones in nucleophilic addition reactions due to two complementary factors: electronic and steric effects. Electronically, the carbonyl carbon in aldehydes (R-CHO) has only one alkyl group attached, while ketones (R-CO-R') have two alkyl groups. Alkyl groups exhibit a +I (positive inductive) effect, donating electron density to the carbonyl carbon and reducing its positive character (δ⁺). Since aldehydes have only one electron-donating group compared to two in ketones, the carbonyl carbon in aldehydes is more electrophilic and thus more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Sterically, aldehydes are less hindered because they have a small hydrogen atom on one side of the carbonyl group, making it easier for nucleophiles to approach and attack the electrophilic carbon. Ketones, having two bulky alkyl groups, create steric hindrance that impedes the approach of nucleophiles. This combined electronic and steric effect makes aldehydes undergo nucleophilic addition reactions more readily than ketones, react faster with weaker nucleophiles, and give higher yields of addition products. This reactivity difference is crucial in synthetic planning and explains why aldehydes respond positively to oxidation tests like Tollen's and Fehling's, while ketones do not."

  question: 'What is the best reagent to oxidize a primary alcohol to an aldehyde without further oxidation to a carboxylic acid?'
  options:
  - PCC (Pyridinium chlorochromate)
  - K₂Cr₂O₇/H⁺
  - KMnO₄
  - Concentrated H₂SO₄
  correct_answer: PCC (Pyridinium chlorochromate)
  explanation: "PCC (Pyridinium chlorochromate) is the reagent of choice for selectively oxidizing primary alcohols to aldehydes without further oxidation to carboxylic acids. Primary alcohols can undergo two consecutive oxidations: first to aldehydes (R-CH₂OH → R-CHO), and then to carboxylic acids (R-CHO → R-COOH). Strong oxidizing agents like K₂Cr₂O₇/H⁺ or KMnO₄ in aqueous acidic conditions will carry out both oxidations, directly converting primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. PCC, however, is a mild oxidizing agent used in anhydrous conditions (typically in dichloromethane), which stops the oxidation at the aldehyde stage. The absence of water prevents the aldehyde from being hydrated to a geminal diol, which would be further oxidized to the carboxylic acid. PCC is a Cr(VI) reagent that selectively oxidizes primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones. For secondary alcohols, over-oxidation is not a concern since ketones resist further oxidation (no hydrogen on the carbonyl carbon). Other mild oxidizing agents like Swern oxidation or Dess-Martin periodinane can also achieve this selective oxidation, but PCC remains one of the most commonly used reagents in organic synthesis for this transformation due to its reliability and ease of use."

  question: 'Which test can distinguish between aldehydes and ketones, giving a positive result only for aldehydes?'
  options:
  - Tollen\'s test (silver mirror test)
  - Sodium bisulfite test
  - Jones oxidation test
  - 2,4-DNP test
  correct_answer: Tollen's test (silver mirror test)
  explanation: "Tollen's test, also known as the silver mirror test, is a classical chemical test that distinguishes aldehydes from ketones. The reagent is Tollen's reagent, which is an ammoniacal silver nitrate solution containing the complex ion [Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺. When an aldehyde is treated with Tollen's reagent under mild alkaline conditions, the aldehyde is oxidized to a carboxylate ion, while the silver ion (Ag⁺) is reduced to metallic silver (Ag), which deposits as a shiny silver mirror on the inner surface of the test tube. The reaction is: R-CHO + 2[Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺ + 3OH⁻ → R-COO⁻ + 2Ag↓ + 4NH₃ + 2H₂O. Ketones do not give this test because they lack the hydrogen atom on the carbonyl carbon that is necessary for easy oxidation under mild conditions. Similarly, Fehling's test (using Cu²⁺ in alkaline tartrate solution) also distinguishes aldehydes (red precipitate of Cu₂O) from ketones (no reaction). In contrast, the sodium bisulfite test and 2,4-DNP test give positive results with both aldehydes and ketones, forming crystalline addition products, so they cannot distinguish between the two. It's important to note that aromatic aldehydes like benzaldehyde do not give Fehling's test but do give Tollen's test, making Tollen's test more general for aldehyde detection."
