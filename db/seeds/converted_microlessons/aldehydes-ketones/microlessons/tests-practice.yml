  Aldehyde-specific tests: (1) Tollen''s test (silver mirror) ✓, (2) Fehling''s test
  (brick-red Cu₂O ppt) ✓. Both oxidize aldehydes to acids. Ketones do not give these
  tests.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which tests are positive for aldehydes but negative for ketones?
  options:
  - Tollen's test and Fehling's test
  - Sodium bisulfite test
  - Iodoform test
  - Brady's test (2,4-DNP test)
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Tollen's test and Fehling's test
  explanation: Aldehydes give positive results with both Tollen's test (silver mirror
    test) and Fehling's test (brick-red precipitate), while ketones do not. In Tollen's
    test, aldehydes are oxidized by ammoniacal silver nitrate (Ag(NH₃)₂⁺) to carboxylic
    acids, reducing Ag⁺ to metallic silver (mirror). In Fehling's test, aldehydes
    reduce Cu²⁺ (blue) to Cu₂O (brick-red precipitate). These are oxidation tests
    - aldehydes are easily oxidized because they have a hydrogen attached to the carbonyl
    carbon, while ketones have two alkyl groups and resist oxidation. The sodium bisulfite
    test is positive for both aldehydes AND methyl ketones, so it doesn't distinguish
    them.

  question: 'What is the visible observation in Tollen''s test when an aldehyde is present?'
  options:
  - Silver mirror formation on the test tube walls
  - Brick-red precipitate
  - Yellow precipitate
  - Blue color
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Silver mirror formation on the test tube walls
  explanation: 'In Tollen''s test (also called silver mirror test), when an aldehyde is present, a shiny silver mirror forms on the inner walls of the test tube. The reagent is Tollen''s reagent: ammoniacal silver nitrate [Ag(NH₃)₂⁺NO₃⁻]. The aldehyde reduces Ag⁺ ions to metallic silver (Ag), which deposits as a mirror: R-CHO + 2[Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺ + 3OH⁻ → R-COO⁻ + 2Ag↓(mirror) + 4NH₃ + 2H₂O. The aldehyde itself gets oxidized to carboxylic acid. Ketones do not give this test because they resist oxidation. The silver mirror is a distinctive and beautiful indication of aldehyde presence, making this test very specific and visually striking.'

  question: 'What is the color change observed in Fehling''s test with aldehydes?'
  options:
  - Blue solution to brick-red precipitate
  - Colorless to yellow
  - Green to brown
  - Red to blue
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Blue solution to brick-red precipitate
  explanation: 'In Fehling''s test, aldehydes reduce the blue Cu²⁺ ions (from copper sulfate in Fehling''s solution) to brick-red Cu₂O (cuprous oxide) precipitate. The color change is from blue solution to brick-red precipitate. Fehling''s reagent consists of two solutions: Fehling''s A (CuSO₄) and Fehling''s B (sodium potassium tartrate in NaOH). When heated with aldehyde: R-CHO + 2Cu²⁺ (blue) + 5OH⁻ → R-COO⁻ + Cu₂O↓(brick-red) + 3H₂O. The aldehyde is oxidized to carboxylate while Cu²⁺ is reduced to Cu⁺. Ketones do not reduce Fehling''s solution, so no color change occurs. This test is similar to Benedict''s test and is positive for aliphatic aldehydes, though aromatic aldehydes may not react.'
