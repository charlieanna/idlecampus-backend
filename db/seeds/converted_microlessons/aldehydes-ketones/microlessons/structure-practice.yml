  question: 'The bond angle around carbonyl carbon in aldehydes and ketones is approximately:'
  options:
  - 109.5°
  - 120°
  - 180°
  - 90°
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: 120°
  explanation: 'The bond angle around the carbonyl carbon in aldehydes and ketones is approximately 120° because the carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized with trigonal planar geometry. The carbonyl carbon forms three σ bonds (one C=O double bond consists of one σ and one π bond, plus two other σ bonds to R groups or H) using three sp² hybrid orbitals, which arrange themselves at 120° to minimize electron repulsion. This is similar to alkenes (C=C) which also have sp² carbons. In contrast, sp³ carbons (like in alkanes) have tetrahedral geometry with 109.5° bond angles, and sp carbons (like in alkynes) have linear geometry with 180° bond angles.'

  question: 'What is the hybridization state of the carbonyl carbon in aldehydes and ketones?'
  options:
  - sp³
  - sp²
  - sp
  - sp³d
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: sp²
  explanation: 'The carbonyl carbon in aldehydes and ketones is sp² hybridized. This sp² hybridization results from mixing one 2s orbital with two 2p orbitals, creating three sp² hybrid orbitals that lie in a plane at 120° angles. These three sp² orbitals form three σ bonds: one to oxygen (part of C=O), one to hydrogen or R group, and one to another R group. The remaining unhybridized p orbital (perpendicular to the plane) overlaps with a p orbital on oxygen to form the π bond of the C=O double bond. This sp² hybridization and trigonal planar geometry is characteristic of all carbonyl compounds including aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, and amides.'

  question: 'The geometry around the carbonyl carbon is:'
  options:
  - Tetrahedral
  - Trigonal planar
  - Linear
  - Bent
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Trigonal planar
  explanation: 'The geometry around the carbonyl carbon is trigonal planar. Due to sp² hybridization, the three groups attached to the carbonyl carbon (O, R/H, and R/H) arrange themselves in a flat plane with bond angles of approximately 120°. This planar arrangement minimizes electron repulsion according to VSEPR theory. The trigonal planar geometry is distinctly different from tetrahedral (sp³, 109.5°) seen in saturated carbons or linear (sp, 180°) seen in alkynes. This planar structure makes the carbonyl carbon accessible to nucleophilic attack from both top and bottom faces, which is important for understanding addition reactions of aldehydes and ketones.'
