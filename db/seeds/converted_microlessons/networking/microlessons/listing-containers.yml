  ## What is docker ps?

  The `docker ps` command lists all running containers on your system, showing their status, names, IDs, and resource usage. It''s one of the most frequently used Docker commands for monitoring and managing containers.


  ## Why It''s Important

  - **Container Visibility**: See what''s currently running on your system

  - **Quick Status Check**: Monitor container health and uptime

  - **Get Container IDs**: Find IDs/names for other Docker commands

  - **Troubleshooting**: Identify stuck or crashed containers

  - **Resource Monitoring**: Check ports and resource allocation


  ## Basic Usage


  ### Show Running Containers

  ```bash

  docker ps

  ```

  Displays all currently running containers with columns:

  - **CONTAINER ID**: Unique identifier (first 12 chars of full ID)

  - **IMAGE**: Image used to create the container

  - **COMMAND**: Command running inside container

  - **CREATED**: When container was created

  - **STATUS**: Current status (Up 2 hours, Exited, etc.)

  - **PORTS**: Port mappings (0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp)

  - **NAMES**: Container name (auto-generated or custom)


  ### Show All Containers (Including Stopped)

  ```bash

  docker ps -a

  ```

  The `-a` or `--all` flag includes stopped and exited containers.


  ### Show Only Container IDs

  ```bash

  docker ps -q

  ```

  The `-q` or `--quiet` flag outputs only container IDs (useful for scripting).


  ### Filter Containers

  ```bash

  # Show containers by status

  docker ps -a --filter "status=exited"


  # Show containers by name

  docker ps --filter "name=web"


  # Show containers by image

  docker ps --filter "ancestor=nginx"

  ```


  ## Common Use Cases


  ### 1. Quick Health Check

  ```bash

  docker ps

  ```

  See if your services are running.


  ### 2. Get Container ID for Commands

  ```bash

  # First, list containers

  docker ps


  # Then use ID for other commands

  docker logs abc123

  docker exec -it abc123 bash

  ```


  ### 3. Stop All Running Containers

  ```bash

  docker stop $(docker ps -q)

  ```

  Combines `docker ps -q` (get IDs) with `docker stop`.


  ### 4. Remove All Stopped Containers

  ```bash

  docker rm $(docker ps -aq --filter "status=exited")

  ```


  ## Pro Tips


  1. **Custom Format**: Use `--format` for custom output

     ```bash

     docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"

     ```


  2. **Watch Mode**: Continuously monitor containers

     ```bash

     watch docker ps

     ```


  3. **Size Information**: See disk usage

     ```bash

     docker ps -s

     ```


  4. **Recent Containers**: Show last created containers

     ```bash

     docker ps -a -n 5

     ```


  ## Syntax/Command


  ```bash

  docker ps

  ```


  ## Key Points


  - `docker ps` shows running containers only

  - `docker ps -a` includes stopped containers

  - `docker ps -q` outputs only container IDs (great for scripting)

  - Use filters to narrow down results by status, name, or image'

  question: Which command lists all containers including stopped ones?
  options:
  - docker ps -a
  - docker list --all
  - docker containers
  - docker ps --running
  correct_answer: docker ps -a
  explanation: "docker ps -a shows all containers regardless of state (running, stopped, exited). By default, docker ps only shows running containers. The -a (or --all) flag includes stopped and exited containers. There is no 'docker list' or 'docker containers' command, and --running is not a valid flag."
