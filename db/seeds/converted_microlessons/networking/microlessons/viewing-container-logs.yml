  question: Which flag follows logs as they are written?
  options:
  - -f
  - -t
  - --tail 100
  - -F
  correct_answer: -f
  explanation: "The -f flag (short for --follow) streams logs in real-time, similar to 'tail -f' on Linux. It keeps the connection open and continuously displays new log entries as the container writes them. The -t flag adds timestamps, --tail 100 shows only the last 100 lines, and -F is not a valid docker logs flag."
