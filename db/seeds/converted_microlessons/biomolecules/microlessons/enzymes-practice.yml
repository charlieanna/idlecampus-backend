  Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts. They are highly specific
  and work at body temperature/pH.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'Enzymes are:'
  options:
  - Biological catalysts that speed up reactions
  - Consumed during chemical reactions
  - Inorganic compounds
  - Non-specific in their action
  correct_answer: Biological catalysts that speed up reactions
  explanation: "Enzymes are biological catalysts, typically proteins, that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms without being consumed in the process. They work by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur. Enzymes are highly specific, meaning each enzyme catalyzes a particular reaction or set of closely related reactions. They function optimally at body temperature and pH, making them essential for life processes. Unlike inorganic catalysts, enzymes are organic molecules and are not consumed during reactions - they can be reused multiple times."

  question: 'The active site of an enzyme is where:'
  options:
  - The substrate binds and the reaction occurs
  - The enzyme is denatured
  - Cofactors are stored
  - The enzyme is synthesized
  correct_answer: The substrate binds and the reaction occurs
  explanation: "The active site is a specific region on the enzyme where the substrate binds. This site has a unique three-dimensional shape that is complementary to the substrate (lock-and-key model) or can undergo conformational changes to fit the substrate (induced-fit model). At the active site, the enzyme-substrate complex forms, and the catalytic reaction occurs. The active site contains specific amino acid residues that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. Denaturation destroys the enzyme structure, cofactors assist enzymes but aren't stored at the active site, and enzyme synthesis occurs at ribosomes."

  question: 'Which factor does NOT typically affect enzyme activity?'
  options:
  - Temperature
  - pH
  - Color of the solution
  - Substrate concentration
  correct_answer: Color of the solution
  explanation: "Enzyme activity is influenced by several factors including temperature (enzymes have optimal temperatures and can be denatured by heat), pH (enzymes have optimal pH ranges and extreme pH can denature them), and substrate concentration (increasing substrate concentration typically increases reaction rate until saturation). However, the color of the solution does not affect enzyme activity - enzymes respond to chemical and physical conditions, not visual properties. Other factors that affect enzyme activity include presence of inhibitors, activators, and cofactors."
