  Starch gives blue color with iodine (diagnostic test). Cellulose gives no color.
  Glucose/fructose are monosaccharides (no iodine test).


  ## Key Points

  question: 'Blue color with iodine is given by:'
  options:
  - Starch
  - Cellulose
  - Glucose
  - Fructose
  correct_answer: Starch
  explanation: "Starch gives a characteristic blue-black color with iodine solution, which is a diagnostic test for starch. This occurs because iodine molecules slip into the helical structure of amylose (a component of starch) forming a starch-iodine complex. Cellulose, despite also being a polymer of glucose, has a different structure (linear β-1,4 linkages) and does not form this complex. Glucose and fructose are monosaccharides and do not give the iodine test - this test is specific for polysaccharides with the helical structure."

  question: 'Cellulose differs from starch in:'
  options:
  - Type of glycosidic linkage (β-1,4 vs α-1,4)
  - Monosaccharide units
  - Molecular weight only
  - Color reaction with iodine
  correct_answer: Type of glycosidic linkage (β-1,4 vs α-1,4)
  explanation: "The key structural difference between cellulose and starch is the type of glycosidic linkage. Cellulose has β-1,4 glycosidic bonds between glucose units, while starch has α-1,4 linkages (and α-1,6 at branch points in amylopectin). This seemingly small difference has huge consequences: the β-linkages in cellulose create a linear, rigid structure that humans cannot digest, while the α-linkages in starch create a helical structure that is easily digestible. Both are polymers of glucose (same monosaccharide units), and while they differ in other properties like iodine reaction, the fundamental difference is the glycosidic linkage."

  question: 'Glycogen is primarily stored in:'
  options:
  - Liver and muscles
  - Blood plasma
  - Adipose tissue
  - Kidneys
  correct_answer: Liver and muscles
  explanation: "Glycogen, often called 'animal starch,' is the storage form of glucose in animals and is primarily stored in the liver and skeletal muscles. The liver can store about 100-120g of glycogen, which can be broken down to maintain blood glucose levels. Muscles store about 400-500g of glycogen for their own energy needs during exercise. Glycogen has a highly branched structure (α-1,4 and α-1,6 linkages) similar to amylopectin in plants, which allows for rapid mobilization of glucose when needed. Adipose tissue stores fat, not glycogen, and blood plasma contains glucose but not glycogen."
