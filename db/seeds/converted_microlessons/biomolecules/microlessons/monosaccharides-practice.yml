  Glucose: 6 carbons (hexose) + aldehyde group (aldo) = Aldohexose. Fructose is ketohexose.
  Ribose is aldopentose.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'Glucose is an example of:'
  options:
  - Aldohexose
  - Ketohexose
  - Aldopentose
  - Ketopentose
  correct_answer: Aldohexose
  explanation: "Glucose is an aldohexose - 'aldo' because it has an aldehyde group (-CHO) at C-1, and 'hexose' because it has 6 carbon atoms. The classification combines the functional group type with the number of carbons. Fructose is a ketohexose (6 carbons with a ketone group), ribose is an aldopentose (5 carbons with an aldehyde), and ribulose is a ketopentose (5 carbons with a ketone). This systematic naming helps identify the structure of monosaccharides."

  question: 'Fructose is a:'
  options:
  - Ketohexose
  - Aldohexose
  - Ketopentose
  - Aldopentose
  correct_answer: Ketohexose
  explanation: "Fructose is a ketohexose - it has 6 carbon atoms (hexose) and contains a ketone group at C-2 (keto). Fructose is the sweetest naturally occurring sugar and is found in fruits, honey, and many vegetables. In solution, fructose can form five-membered (furanose) and six-membered (pyranose) rings, though the furanose form is more common in sucrose. Unlike glucose which is an aldohexose (aldehyde group), fructose has its carbonyl group at position 2 as a ketone. This structural difference affects their metabolism and sweetness."

  question: 'The number of asymmetric carbon atoms in glucose is:'
  options:
  - 4
  - 3
  - 5
  - 6
  correct_answer: 4
  explanation: "Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) has 4 asymmetric (chiral) carbon atoms at positions C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-5. An asymmetric carbon is one that is bonded to four different groups. C-1 has the aldehyde group and is not chiral in the open-chain form, while C-6 is the CH₂OH group and is also not chiral. These 4 chiral centers give rise to 2⁴ = 16 possible stereoisomers (including glucose, mannose, galactose, etc.). The presence of these chiral centers is why D-glucose and L-glucose are mirror images (enantiomers) and why optical activity is important in carbohydrate chemistry."
