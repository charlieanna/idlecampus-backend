  question: What is a peptide bond, how is it formed, and what type of chemical linkage
    does it represent?
  options:
  - A hydrogen bond between amino acids
  - An amide linkage (-CO-NH-) formed by condensation between the carboxyl group of
    one amino acid and the amino group of another, releasing water
  - A disulfide bridge between cysteine residues
  - An ester bond formed between hydroxyl and carboxyl groups
  correct_answer: An amide linkage (-CO-NH-) formed by condensation between the carboxyl
    group of one amino acid and the amino group of another, releasing water
  explanation: 'A peptide bond is the fundamental covalent bond linking amino acids
    into proteins. It forms through a condensation reaction (dehydration synthesis)
    where the carboxyl group (-COOH) of one amino acid reacts with the amino group
    (-NH₂) of another amino acid. The mechanism: H₂N-CHR₁-COOH + H₂N-CHR₂-COOH → H₂N-CHR₁-CO-NH-CHR₂-COOH
    + H₂O. The -OH from the carboxyl and an -H from the amino group combine to form
    water (H₂O), leaving the -CO-NH- linkage called a peptide bond. Chemically, this
    is an amide bond (carbonyl C=O bonded to nitrogen). The resulting molecule is
    a dipeptide; continuing the process creates polypeptides and proteins. Properties
    of peptide bonds: (1) Partial double-bond character due to resonance, making them
    rigid and planar, (2) Trans configuration is favored, (3) Can be hydrolyzed (reverse
    reaction) by enzymes or acids. This is distinct from other biological bonds: disulfide
    bridges (S-S) form between cysteine residues providing tertiary structure stability,
    hydrogen bonds create secondary structure (α-helix, β-sheet), and ionic/hydrophobic
    interactions contribute to protein folding. The peptide bond is the primary structure
    - the backbone of all proteins.'

  question: What are the four levels of protein structure, and what forces/bonds are
    responsible for each level?
  options:
  - Primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary - all held together by peptide bonds
  - 'Primary: sequence of amino acids (peptide bonds); Secondary: α-helix/β-sheet
    (H-bonds); Tertiary: 3D folding (multiple interactions); Quaternary: multiple
    polypeptide chains'
  - Only primary and secondary structures exist in proteins
  - All four levels are determined solely by disulfide bridges
  correct_answer: 'Primary: sequence of amino acids (peptide bonds); Secondary: α-helix/β-sheet
    (H-bonds); Tertiary: 3D folding (multiple interactions); Quaternary: multiple
    polypeptide chains'
  explanation: 'Protein structure has four hierarchical levels, each stabilized by
    different forces. PRIMARY STRUCTURE: The linear sequence of amino acids connected
    by peptide bonds (covalent -CO-NH- linkages). Example: Gly-Ala-Ser-Cys... This
    sequence determines all higher structures and is encoded by DNA. SECONDARY STRUCTURE:
    Local folding patterns formed by hydrogen bonding between backbone atoms (C=O
    of one residue with N-H of another). Two main types: α-helix (right-handed spiral,
    H-bonds between i and i+4 residues) and β-pleated sheet (extended strands, H-bonds
    between adjacent chains/regions). These are regular, repeating patterns. TERTIARY
    STRUCTURE: The overall 3D shape of a single polypeptide chain, stabilized by multiple
    interactions between side chains (R groups): (1) Disulfide bridges (covalent S-S
    bonds between cysteines), (2) Hydrogen bonds, (3) Ionic bonds (salt bridges between
    charged residues), (4) Hydrophobic interactions (nonpolar residues cluster in
    core), (5) Van der Waals forces. Enzymes achieve their specific catalytic shape
    through tertiary structure. QUATERNARY STRUCTURE: Assembly of multiple polypeptide
    chains (subunits) into a functional protein complex. Example: Hemoglobin has 4
    subunits (2α + 2β chains). Stabilized by same non-covalent forces as tertiary.
    Not all proteins have quaternary structure - only multi-subunit proteins. Denaturation
    disrupts secondary/tertiary/quaternary structure (heat, pH changes) while maintaining
    primary structure, causing loss of function.'

  question: What are the key structural and functional differences between DNA and
    RNA?
  options:
  - DNA is single-stranded; RNA is double-stranded
  - DNA has ribose sugar; RNA has deoxyribose sugar
  - DNA has deoxyribose sugar, bases A/G/C/T, double helix structure, stores genetic
    info in nucleus; RNA has ribose sugar, bases A/G/C/U, single strand, synthesizes
    proteins
  - DNA and RNA are chemically identical but serve different functions
  correct_answer: DNA has deoxyribose sugar, bases A/G/C/T, double helix structure,
    stores genetic info in nucleus; RNA has ribose sugar, bases A/G/C/U, single strand,
    synthesizes proteins
  explanation: 'DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) are both nucleic
    acid polymers of nucleotides, but differ structurally and functionally. SUGAR:
    DNA contains deoxyribose (C₅H₁₀O₄, lacking one oxygen on 2'' carbon), while RNA
    contains ribose (C₅H₁₀O₅, has -OH on 2'' carbon). This makes RNA more reactive
    and less stable. BASES: DNA uses purines (Adenine, Guanine) and pyrimidines (Cytosine,
    Thymine). RNA uses A, G, C but replaces thymine with Uracil (U). STRUCTURE: DNA
    is typically a double helix (Watson-Crick model) with complementary strands: A
    pairs with T via 2 hydrogen bonds, G pairs with C via 3 hydrogen bonds. RNA is
    usually single-stranded but can form hairpins/loops through self-complementary
    base pairing. LOCATION: DNA is primarily in the nucleus (eukaryotes) or nucleoid
    (prokaryotes), though mitochondria have their own DNA. RNA is found in both nucleus
    and cytoplasm. FUNCTION: DNA stores genetic information (the genome) - a stable,
    long-term archive. RNA has multiple roles: mRNA (messenger RNA) carries genetic
    information from DNA to ribosomes, tRNA (transfer RNA) brings amino acids to ribosomes,
    rRNA (ribosomal RNA) forms ribosome structure. RNA enables protein synthesis -
    the central dogma: DNA → RNA → Protein. STABILITY: DNA is more stable (double-strand,
    lacks reactive 2''-OH), suitable for long-term storage. RNA is less stable, suitable
    for temporary messages.'
