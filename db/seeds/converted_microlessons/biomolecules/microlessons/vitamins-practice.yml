  question: Which vitamins are water-soluble?
  options:
  - Vitamin B and C
  - Vitamin A and D
  - Vitamin E and K
  - Vitamin D and E
  correct_answer: Vitamin B and C
  explanation: "Vitamins B (B-complex) and C are water-soluble vitamins. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water and are not stored in significant amounts in the body - excess amounts are typically excreted in urine. This means they need to be consumed regularly through diet. In contrast, vitamins A, D, E, and K are fat-soluble vitamins that dissolve in fats and oils. Fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in the liver and fatty tissues for longer periods, so they don't need to be consumed as frequently but can accumulate to toxic levels if taken in excess."

  question: 'Vitamin C deficiency causes:'
  options:
  - Scurvy
  - Rickets
  - Night blindness
  - Beriberi
  correct_answer: Scurvy
  explanation: "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency causes scurvy, a disease characterized by bleeding gums, loose teeth, poor wound healing, and weakened connective tissue. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis, which is crucial for maintaining healthy skin, blood vessels, and connective tissues. Rickets is caused by vitamin D deficiency, night blindness by vitamin A deficiency, and beriberi by vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiency. Sailors on long voyages historically suffered from scurvy until the connection with fresh fruits (especially citrus) was discovered."

  question: 'Which vitamin is known as the sunshine vitamin?'
  options:
  - Vitamin D
  - Vitamin A
  - Vitamin E
  - Vitamin K
  correct_answer: Vitamin D
  explanation: "Vitamin D is called the 'sunshine vitamin' because it can be synthesized in the skin when exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight. The skin converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3, which is then converted to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption and bone health - its deficiency leads to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. While vitamin D can also be obtained from dietary sources like fatty fish and fortified milk, sunlight exposure is a major source for most people."
