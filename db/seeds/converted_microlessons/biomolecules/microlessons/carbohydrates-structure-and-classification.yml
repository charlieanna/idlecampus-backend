  question: 'What is the key structural difference between starch and cellulose that makes cellulose indigestible to humans?'
  options:
  - Starch has α(1→4) glycosidic linkages while cellulose has β(1→4) glycosidic linkages
  - Starch is made of glucose while cellulose is made of fructose
  - Starch has linear chains while cellulose has branched chains
  - Starch has peptide bonds while cellulose has glycosidic bonds
  correct_answer: Starch has α(1→4) glycosidic linkages while cellulose has β(1→4) glycosidic linkages
  explanation: "Both starch and cellulose are polysaccharides composed of glucose monomers with the formula (C₆H₁₀O₅)ₙ, but they differ fundamentally in the type of glycosidic linkage connecting the glucose units. Starch (including both amylose and amylopectin) contains α(1→4) glycosidic linkages, where the -OH group on the anomeric carbon (C-1) of glucose is in the axial (down) position. In contrast, cellulose has β(1→4) glycosidic linkages, where the -OH group is in the equatorial (up) position. This seemingly small stereochemical difference has profound biological consequences. Humans and most animals possess the enzyme amylase, which can hydrolyze α(1→4) bonds in starch, breaking it down into maltose and glucose for energy. However, humans lack the enzyme cellulase needed to hydrolyze β(1→4) bonds in cellulose. As a result, cellulose passes through the human digestive system undigested and serves as dietary fiber. The β-linkage also allows cellulose chains to form extensive hydrogen bonding networks, creating strong, rigid fibers that provide structural support in plant cell walls, making cellulose the most abundant organic compound on Earth. This structural difference explains why we can digest bread (starch) but not wood or cotton (cellulose)."

  question: 'Why is sucrose classified as a non-reducing sugar?'
  options:
  - Because both anomeric carbons (C-1 of glucose and C-2 of fructose) are involved in the glycosidic linkage, leaving no free carbonyl group
  - Because sucrose contains only ketone groups
  - Because sucrose is a monosaccharide
  - Because sucrose cannot be hydrolyzed
  correct_answer: Because both anomeric carbons (C-1 of glucose and C-2 of fructose) are involved in the glycosidic linkage, leaving no free carbonyl group
  explanation: "Reducing sugars are carbohydrates that can act as reducing agents because they have a free aldehyde group (-CHO) or ketone group (>C=O) that can be oxidized. The reducing property is tested by Fehling's test, Benedict's test, or Tollen's test, which detect the presence of free carbonyl groups. Sucrose (table sugar) is a disaccharide composed of α-D-glucose and β-D-fructose connected by an α(1→2) glycosidic linkage. The critical point is that this linkage involves the anomeric carbon of glucose (C-1) AND the anomeric carbon of fructose (C-2). Since both anomeric carbons participate in forming the glycosidic bond, neither sugar unit has a free hemiacetal or hemiketal form, meaning there is no free carbonyl group available. Without a free carbonyl group, sucrose cannot reduce oxidizing agents like Cu²⁺ or Ag⁺, hence it is non-reducing. In contrast, maltose and lactose are reducing disaccharides because one of their glucose units has a free anomeric carbon that can exist in equilibrium with the open-chain aldehyde form. When sucrose is hydrolyzed (by acid or the enzyme invertase) into glucose and fructose, both monosaccharides are reducing sugars. This property of sucrose is important in food chemistry and is used to distinguish it from other sugars."

  question: 'Glucose and fructose have the same molecular formula (C₆H₁₂O₆). What is the fundamental structural difference between them?'
  options:
  - Glucose is an aldohexose (aldehyde at C-1) while fructose is a ketohexose (ketone at C-2)
  - Glucose has 6 carbons while fructose has 5 carbons
  - Glucose is a pentose while fructose is a hexose
  - Glucose is a disaccharide while fructose is a monosaccharide
  correct_answer: Glucose is an aldohexose (aldehyde at C-1) while fructose is a ketohexose (ketone at C-2)
  explanation: "Glucose and fructose are structural isomers (specifically, functional group isomers) of each other, both having the molecular formula C₆H₁₂O₆, but differing in the position and type of their carbonyl group. Glucose is classified as an aldohexose because it contains an aldehyde functional group (-CHO) at carbon-1 and has six carbon atoms. Its open-chain structure shows the aldehyde group at the top: CHO-CHOH-CHOH-CHOH-CHOH-CH₂OH. Fructose, on the other hand, is a ketohexose because it has a ketone functional group (>C=O) at carbon-2 rather than at the terminal carbon. Both are hexoses (six-carbon sugars), but their different functional groups give them different chemical and physical properties. For example, fructose is the sweetest naturally occurring sugar, sweeter than glucose or sucrose. In solution, both glucose and fructose exist predominantly in cyclic forms: glucose forms six-membered pyranose rings (α and β forms), while fructose typically forms five-membered furanose rings. Despite having different functional groups in their open-chain forms, both glucose and fructose give the same osazone when treated with phenylhydrazine, because the reaction involves C-1 and C-2, converting both sugars to the same derivative. This isomerism is important in understanding carbohydrate metabolism and the sweetness of different sugars."
