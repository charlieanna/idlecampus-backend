  question: 'Arrange the following alcohols in order of increasing acidity: CH₃OH, (CH₃)₃COH, CH₃CH₂OH, (CH₃)₂CHOH'
  options:
  - CH₃OH < CH₃CH₂OH < (CH₃)₂CHOH < (CH₃)₃COH
  - (CH₃)₃COH < (CH₃)₂CHOH < CH₃CH₂OH < CH₃OH
  - CH₃CH₂OH < (CH₃)₂CHOH < (CH₃)₃COH < CH₃OH
  - (CH₃)₂CHOH < CH₃OH < CH₃CH₂OH < (CH₃)₃COH
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: (CH₃)₃COH < (CH₃)₂CHOH < CH₃CH₂OH < CH₃OH
  explanation: 'The acidity of alcohols decreases in the order: methanol > 1° > 2° > 3°. This is because alkyl groups have a +I (electron-donating) inductive effect that destabilizes the alkoxide anion (RO⁻) formed when the alcohol loses a proton. More alkyl groups mean more +I effect, leading to less stable anions and thus weaker acids. Methanol (CH₃OH) has only one methyl group, making it the most acidic. Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH, 1°) has two alkyl groups, isopropanol ((CH₃)₂CHOH, 2°) has three, and tert-butanol ((CH₃)₃COH, 3°) has four alkyl groups, making it the least acidic. The correct order of increasing acidity is: (CH₃)₃COH < (CH₃)₂CHOH < CH₃CH₂OH < CH₃OH.'

  question: 'Which alcohol is the strongest acid?'
  options:
  - Tert-butanol
  - Isopropanol
  - Ethanol
  - Methanol
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Methanol
  explanation: 'Methanol (CH₃OH) is the strongest acid among simple alcohols. The acidity of alcohols is determined by the stability of the conjugate base (alkoxide ion, RO⁻). Alkyl groups exert a positive inductive effect (+I effect), which donates electron density to the negatively charged oxygen in the alkoxide ion. This electron donation destabilizes the anion, making the alcohol less acidic. Methanol has only one small methyl group, so it experiences the least destabilization. In contrast, tert-butanol has three methyl groups, which significantly destabilize its alkoxide ion through the +I effect, making it the weakest acid. The order of acidity is: CH₃OH > 1° alcohols > 2° alcohols > 3° alcohols.'

  question: 'The +I (positive inductive) effect of alkyl groups in alcohols:'
  options:
  - Stabilizes the alkoxide anion and increases acidity
  - Destabilizes the alkoxide anion and decreases acidity
  - Has no effect on acidity
  - Only affects tertiary alcohols
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Destabilizes the alkoxide anion and decreases acidity
  explanation: 'The +I (positive inductive) effect refers to the electron-donating nature of alkyl groups through sigma bonds. When an alcohol loses a proton to form an alkoxide ion (R-O⁻), the negative charge resides on the oxygen atom. Alkyl groups donate electron density toward this negatively charged oxygen, which increases the electron density on an already electron-rich atom. This destabilizes the alkoxide anion because like charges repel. A less stable conjugate base means the equilibrium shifts away from deprotonation, making the alcohol less acidic. More alkyl groups (as in 2° and 3° alcohols) provide more +I effect, leading to greater destabilization and lower acidity. This is why methanol (least alkyl substitution) is more acidic than tertiary alcohols (most alkyl substitution).'
