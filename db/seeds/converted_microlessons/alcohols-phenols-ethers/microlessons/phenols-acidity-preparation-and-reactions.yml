  question: 'Why is phenol (C₆H₅OH) more acidic than ethanol (C₂H₅OH)?'
  options:
  - The phenoxide ion is stabilized by resonance delocalization into the benzene ring
  - Phenol has a higher molecular weight than ethanol
  - The benzene ring is electron-withdrawing due to sp² hybridization
  - Phenol forms stronger hydrogen bonds than ethanol
  correct_answer: The phenoxide ion is stabilized by resonance delocalization into the benzene ring
  explanation: "Phenol is significantly more acidic (pKa ≈ 10) than alcohols like ethanol (pKa ≈ 16) due to the stability of the conjugate base formed after deprotonation. When phenol loses a proton, it forms the phenoxide ion (C₆H₅O⁻), which is highly stabilized by resonance. The negative charge on the oxygen atom can delocalize into the benzene ring through four resonance structures, spreading the negative charge over the entire aromatic system. This extensive delocalization makes the phenoxide ion much more stable than the ethoxide ion (C₂H₅O⁻), where the negative charge is localized entirely on the oxygen atom with no possibility of delocalization. According to the principle that a more stable conjugate base corresponds to a stronger acid, phenol is more acidic. The stability of the phenoxide ion explains why phenol reacts with NaOH to form sodium phenoxide, while alcohols do not react with bases under normal conditions. This difference in acidity is fundamental to understanding the chemical behavior of phenolic compounds and is crucial for predicting reactivity patterns in organic chemistry, particularly in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions where the -OH group acts as a strong activating substituent."

  question: 'In the Reimer-Tiemann reaction, phenol reacts with chloroform in the presence of NaOH. What is the major product?'
  options:
  - o-Hydroxybenzaldehyde (Salicylaldehyde)
  - p-Hydroxybenzaldehyde
  - Benzoic acid
  - 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol
  correct_answer: o-Hydroxybenzaldehyde (Salicylaldehyde)
  explanation: "The Reimer-Tiemann reaction is an important named reaction for introducing a formyl group (-CHO) onto the aromatic ring of phenol. When phenol is treated with chloroform (CHCl₃) in the presence of strong base (NaOH) and heat, the major product is o-hydroxybenzaldehyde, commonly known as salicylaldehyde. The mechanism involves the formation of dichlorocarbene (:CCl₂) from chloroform under basic conditions. This highly reactive intermediate attacks the benzene ring, preferentially at the ortho position due to the directing effect of the phenoxide ion formed in the alkaline medium. The -OH group is a strong ortho-para directing group, but the ortho position is favored in this reaction due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the product. After hydrolysis, the intermediate converts to the aldehyde group. While some para product also forms, the ortho isomer (salicylaldehyde) is the major product. This reaction is synthetically useful for preparing aromatic aldehydes directly from phenols, and salicylaldehyde itself is an important intermediate in organic synthesis. It should not be confused with the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction, which introduces a carboxyl group (-COOH) using CO₂ instead of chloroform."

  question: 'Arrange the following compounds in order of increasing acidity: (I) Phenol, (II) p-Nitrophenol, (III) p-Methylphenol'
  options:
  - III < I < II
  - I < III < II
  - II < I < III
  - III < II < I
  correct_answer: III < I < II
  explanation: "The acidity of phenolic compounds is strongly influenced by substituents on the benzene ring through electronic effects. The order of increasing acidity is: p-Methylphenol (pKa ≈ 10.3) < Phenol (pKa ≈ 10.0) < p-Nitrophenol (pKa ≈ 7.1). This trend can be explained by examining how substituents affect the stability of the phenoxide ion. The nitro group (-NO₂) is a strong electron-withdrawing group that operates through both resonance (-M effect) and inductive (-I effect). When present at the para position, it stabilizes the phenoxide ion by delocalizing the negative charge through resonance, making p-nitrophenol significantly more acidic than phenol. Conversely, the methyl group (-CH₃) is an electron-donating group (+I effect) that destabilizes the phenoxide ion by increasing electron density, making p-methylphenol less acidic than phenol. The para and ortho positions show stronger effects than meta due to direct resonance interaction with the oxygen atom. This principle is general: electron-withdrawing groups (EWG) like -NO₂, -CN, -COOH increase acidity, while electron-donating groups (EDG) like -CH₃, -OCH₃, -NH₂ decrease acidity. Understanding these substituent effects is essential for predicting reactivity and designing synthetic routes in organic chemistry."
