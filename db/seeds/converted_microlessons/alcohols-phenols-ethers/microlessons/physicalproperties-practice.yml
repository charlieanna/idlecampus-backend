  Alcohols form strong intermolecular H-bonds (R-O-H···O-H-R), requiring more energy
  to break. Ethers cannot H-bond with each other (no H on O). BP: Ethanol 78°C vs
  Dimethyl ether -24°C.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Why do alcohols have higher boiling points than ethers of similar molecular
    weight?
  options:
  - Alcohols are more polar
  - Alcohols can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds
  - Alcohols have higher molecular weight
  - Ethers decompose at low temperature
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Alcohols can form intermolecular hydrogen bonds
  explanation: 'Alcohols have significantly higher boiling points than ethers of similar
    molecular weight because alcohols can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds
    (R-O-H···O-H-R). The hydrogen bonding occurs between the partially positive hydrogen
    of the -OH group in one molecule and the partially negative oxygen in another
    molecule. Ethers (R-O-R'') have oxygen but no hydrogen attached to it, so they
    cannot form hydrogen bonds with each other (though they can be hydrogen bond acceptors
    with water or alcohols). This requires much more energy to break the hydrogen
    bonds in alcohols during boiling. Example: Ethanol (C₂H₅OH, MW=46) has BP=78°C
    while dimethyl ether (CH₃-O-CH₃, MW=46) has BP=-24°C, a difference of over 100°C
    despite identical molecular weights.'

  question: 'Why are lower alcohols (like methanol, ethanol, propanol) soluble in water?'
  options:
  - They have low molecular weight
  - They can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules
  - They are polar and ionic
  - They react with water to form ions
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: They can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules
  explanation: 'Lower alcohols (C₁-C₃) are completely miscible with water because they can form extensive hydrogen bonding with water molecules. The -OH group in alcohols can act as both a hydrogen bond donor (the H in -OH) and a hydrogen bond acceptor (the O in -OH), just like water. This allows alcohol molecules to integrate into the hydrogen bonding network of water. The interaction R-O-H···O-H₂ and R-O···H-O-H is energetically favorable. As the hydrocarbon chain length increases, the hydrophobic (water-repelling) character of the alkyl group dominates over the hydrophilic (water-attracting) -OH group, and solubility decreases. Methanol, ethanol, and propanol are infinitely soluble in water. Butanol (C₄) is partially soluble, while higher alcohols (C₅ and above) are increasingly insoluble. The rule of thumb: "like dissolves like" - the polar -OH group makes alcohols compatible with polar water.'

  question: 'Arrange the following compounds in order of increasing boiling point: 1-butanol (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂OH), diethyl ether (CH₃CH₂OCH₂CH₃), pentane (CH₃CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃)'
  options:
  - Pentane < diethyl ether < 1-butanol
  - 1-butanol < diethyl ether < pentane
  - Diethyl ether < pentane < 1-butanol
  - Pentane < 1-butanol < diethyl ether
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Pentane < diethyl ether < 1-butanol
  explanation: 'The order of increasing boiling point is: pentane (36°C) < diethyl ether (35°C) < 1-butanol (117°C). All three compounds have similar molecular weights (pentane=72, diethyl ether=74, 1-butanol=74), so differences in boiling point are due to intermolecular forces. 1-butanol has the highest BP because it can form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds (R-O-H···O-H-R). Diethyl ether has a moderately low BP because it can only form weak dipole-dipole interactions (it has a polar C-O-C bond but cannot hydrogen bond with itself). Pentane has the lowest BP because it is nonpolar and can only form very weak London dispersion forces (van der Waals forces). The trend: hydrogen bonding > dipole-dipole > dispersion forces. This explains the BP order. Note: While the actual BPs of pentane and diethyl ether are very close, 1-butanol''s BP is dramatically higher due to hydrogen bonding.'
