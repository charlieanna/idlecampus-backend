  \    **Reaction:**\n    ```\n    R-O⁻ + R'-X → R-O-R' + X⁻  (SN2)\n    ```\n\n \
  \   **Mechanism:** SN2 nucleophilic substitution\n\n    **Best conditions:**\n \
  \   - **Primary alkyl halide** (R'-X)\n    - **Alkoxide ion** (R-O⁻ from R-OH +\
  \ Na)\n\n    **Example 1 (Symmetrical):**\n    ```\n    2C₂H₅OH + 2Na → 2C₂H₅O⁻Na⁺\
  \ + H₂\n\n    C₂H₅O⁻Na⁺ + C₂H₅Br → C₂H₅-O-C₂H₅ + NaBr\n    ```\n\n    **Example\
  \ 2 (Unsymmetrical):**\n    ```\n    CH₃O⁻Na⁺ + C₂H₅Br → CH₃-O-C₂H₅ + NaBr\n   \
  \ ```\n\n    **Important:**\n    - Use **1° alkyl halide** for best results (SN2)\n\
  \    - **Avoid 3° halides** (gives elimination E2)\n\n    **For aryl ethers:**\n\
  \    ```\n    C₆H₅O⁻Na⁺ + CH₃I → C₆H₅-O-CH₃ (Anisole) + NaI\n    ```\n\n    ###\

  \ 413 K]--> R-O-R + H₂O\n    ```\n\n    **Conditions:**\n    - **Lower temperature\
  \ (413 K):** Ether formation\n    - **Higher temperature (443 K):** Alkene formation\
  \ (dehydration)\n\n    **Example:**\n    ```\n    2C₂H₅OH --[H₂SO₄, 140°C]--> C₂H₅-O-C₂H₅\

  \       (Methyl iodide) (Ethanol)\n\n    C₂H₅-OH + HI → C₂H₅-I + H₂O  (with excess\
  \ HI)\n    ```\n\n    **Reactivity:** HI > HBr >> HCl\n\n    **For unsymmetrical\
  \ ethers:**\n    - **Smaller alkyl group** forms halide (SN2 easier)\n    - **Larger\
  \ alkyl group** forms alcohol\n\n    **With aromatic ethers:**\n    ```\n    C₆H₅-O-CH₃\
  \ + HI → C₆H₅-OH + CH₃-I\n                      (Phenol)    (Methyl iodide)\n\n\
  \    (NOT C₆H₅-I because Ar-O is very strong)\n    ```\n\n    ### 2. With PCl₅ or\
  \ PCl₃\n    ```\n    R-O-R + PCl₅ → R-Cl + R-Cl + POCl₃\n    ```\n\n    ### 3. Halogenation\n\
  \    ```\n    R-O-R + Cl₂ --[UV]--> R-O-CHCl-R + HCl  (α-substitution)\n    ```\n\
  \n    **Halogenation at α-carbon** (carbon next to oxygen)\n\n    ### 4. Formation\
  \ of Oxonium Salts\n    ```\n    R-O-R + H⁺ → [R-O⁺H-R]  (Oxonium ion)\n    ```\n\

  question: In Williamson ether synthesis (R-O⁻ + R'-X → R-O-R'), why must you use
    a primary alkyl halide (R'-X) rather than a tertiary alkyl halide, and what happens
    if you use a tertiary halide?
  options:
  - Primary halides are cheaper than tertiary halides
  - The reaction is SN2; primary halides undergo SN2 smoothly, but tertiary halides
    undergo E2 elimination instead due to steric hindrance, forming alkenes not ethers
  - Tertiary halides are too stable to react at all
  - Primary and tertiary halides work equally well in Williamson synthesis
  correct_answer: The reaction is SN2; primary halides undergo SN2 smoothly, but tertiary
    halides undergo E2 elimination instead due to steric hindrance, forming alkenes
    not ethers
  explanation: 'Williamson ether synthesis proceeds through SN2 (nucleophilic substitution,
    second order) mechanism where alkoxide ion (R-O⁻) attacks the alkyl halide (R''-X).
    SN2 MECHANISM: Requires backside attack by nucleophile on carbon bearing the leaving
    group (X). The transition state is crowded with 5 groups around carbon (nucleophile,
    leaving group, 3 substituents on carbon). ALKYL HALIDE REACTIVITY in SN2: Primary
    (1°) halides have least steric hindrance (only 2 carbons + 1 H around the carbon),
    allowing easy backside attack. Reaction is fast and clean: CH₃O⁻Na⁺ + CH₃CH₂Br
    → CH₃-O-CH₂CH₃ (methyl ethyl ether) + NaBr. Secondary (2°) halides are moderately
    hindered; SN2 is slower, competes with elimination. Tertiary (3°) halides are
    highly sterically hindered (3 bulky alkyl groups block backside attack). SN2 is
    essentially impossible. Instead, the strong base (R-O⁻) abstracts a β-hydrogen
    (E2 elimination), forming an alkene: (CH₃)₃C-Br + CH₃O⁻ → (CH₃)₂C=CH₂ (isobutylene)
    + CH₃OH + Br⁻. No ether forms. BEST PRACTICE: Always use primary alkyl halides
    or methyl halides for Williamson synthesis. For making unsymmetrical ethers, choose
    wisely: to make CH₃-O-C(CH₃)₃, use (CH₃)₃C-O⁻ + CH₃I (methyl iodide is primary),
    NOT CH₃O⁻ + (CH₃)₃C-Br (tert-butyl bromide would eliminate). This selectivity
    is critical for synthesis planning in organic chemistry.'

  question: When cleaving an unsymmetrical ether (R-O-R') with HI, how do you predict
    which alkyl group forms the alkyl iodide and which forms the alcohol?
  options:
  - The larger alkyl group always forms the alkyl iodide
  - The smaller alkyl group forms the alkyl iodide (via SN2), and the larger alkyl
    group forms the alcohol because SN2 is faster on less hindered carbons
  - Both alkyl groups form iodides equally
  - The group with more carbons becomes the alcohol
  correct_answer: The smaller alkyl group forms the alkyl iodide (via SN2), and the
    larger alkyl group forms the alcohol because SN2 is faster on less hindered carbons
  explanation: 'Ether cleavage with HI proceeds through protonation followed by SN2
    attack. MECHANISM: (1) Protonation: R-O-R'' + HI → [R-O⁺H-R''] + I⁻ (oxonium ion
    formation). The ether oxygen accepts a proton, converting the poor leaving group
    (-OR'') into a good leaving group (-O⁺HR''). (2) SN2 attack: I⁻ (nucleophile)
    attacks one of the two carbons bonded to oxygen. Which carbon? The LESS HINDERED
    one (SN2 preference). Result: R-O⁺H-R'' + I⁻ → R-I + R''-OH (if R is smaller/less
    hindered). EXAMPLE: Methyl ethyl ether (CH₃-O-C₂H₅) + HI. Protonation: [CH₃-O⁺H-C₂H₅]
    + I⁻. SN2 attack: I⁻ attacks CH₃ carbon (methyl is less hindered than ethyl).
    Product: CH₃-I (methyl iodide) + C₂H₅-OH (ethanol). Not the reverse (C₂H₅-I +
    CH₃-OH) because SN2 on ethyl is slower. GENERAL RULE: In R-O-R'', the smaller,
    less substituted alkyl group becomes R-I (alkyl iodide). The larger, more substituted
    group becomes R''-OH (alcohol). PRIMARY > SECONDARY in SN2 reactivity. AROMATIC
    ETHERS: Special case. Anisole (C₆H₅-O-CH₃) + HI → C₆H₅-OH (phenol) + CH₃-I (methyl
    iodide). The phenyl-oxygen bond is very strong (partial double bond character
    from resonance), so I⁻ attacks methyl exclusively. You NEVER get C₆H₅-I from ether
    cleavage. With EXCESS HI: The alcohol formed (R''-OH) can further react: R''-OH
    + HI → R''-I + H₂O. So ultimate products with excess HI: R-I + R''-I + H₂O (both
    alkyl iodides). This understanding is essential for predicting organic reaction
    products.'

  question: Why do ethers have much lower boiling points than alcohols of similar
    molecular weight, and what intermolecular forces are responsible?
  options:
  - Ethers are gases at room temperature; alcohols are always liquids
  - Alcohols can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds (strong intermolecular forces),
    while ethers can only accept hydrogen bonds, resulting in weaker intermolecular
    forces and lower boiling points
  - Ethers have stronger intermolecular forces but lower molecular weights
  - Boiling points are identical for ethers and alcohols
  correct_answer: Alcohols can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds (strong intermolecular
    forces), while ethers can only accept hydrogen bonds, resulting in weaker intermolecular
    forces and lower boiling points
  explanation: 'Boiling points depend on intermolecular forces - stronger forces require
    more energy to separate molecules (higher BP). ALCOHOLS (R-OH): The -OH group
    has highly polar O-H bond with hydrogen attached to electronegative oxygen. This
    enables HYDROGEN BONDING - the strongest type of intermolecular force (dipole-dipole
    interaction where H is bonded to N, O, or F). Crucially, alcohols can both DONATE
    hydrogen bonds (the H on -OH) and ACCEPT hydrogen bonds (the lone pairs on O).
    This creates extensive hydrogen bonding networks between alcohol molecules: R-O-H···O-H-R···O-H-R
    (each molecule bonded to multiple neighbors). Example: Ethanol (C₂H₅OH, MW=46)
    has BP = 78°C due to strong H-bonding. ETHERS (R-O-R''): The oxygen has lone pairs
    and is electronegative, so ethers can ACCEPT hydrogen bonds from other molecules
    with -OH or -NH groups. However, ethers have no H bonded to oxygen, so they CANNOT
    DONATE hydrogen bonds. Ether-ether interactions are only weak dipole-dipole forces
    (C-O-C dipole moment) and van der Waals forces, much weaker than hydrogen bonding.
    Example: Dimethyl ether (CH₃-O-CH₃, MW=46) has BP = -24°C - vastly lower than
    ethanol despite identical molecular weight. COMPARISON: Ethanol (78°C) >> Dimethyl
    ether (-24°C) ≈ Propane (C₃H₈, -42°C). Ether BP similar to alkanes because both
    lack H-bonding. CONSEQUENCE: Ethers make excellent solvents - they dissolve polar
    compounds (can accept H-bonds from them) yet remain relatively low-boiling for
    easy evaporation. Diethyl ether''s volatility made it suitable as an anesthetic
    (though flammability was dangerous). This property difference is fundamental to
    understanding organic compound behavior.'
