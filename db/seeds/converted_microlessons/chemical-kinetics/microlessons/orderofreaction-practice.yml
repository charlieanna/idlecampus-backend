  Rate = k[A]ⁿ. When [A] → 2[A], rate → 4×rate. So 2ⁿ = 4, n = 2 (second order)


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'For a reaction with rate law: Rate = k[A]²[B], what is the overall order of the reaction?'
  options:
  - First order
  - Second order
  - Third order
  - Fourth order
  correct_answer: Third order
  explanation: 'The overall order of a reaction is the sum of all the exponents (powers) in the rate law. For Rate = k[A]²[B]: Order with respect to A = 2 (exponent of [A]). Order with respect to B = 1 (exponent of [B]). Overall order = 2 + 1 = 3 (third order). Physical interpretation: (1) If [A] is doubled while [B] is constant, rate increases by 2² = 4 times. (2) If [B] is doubled while [A] is constant, rate increases by 2¹ = 2 times. (3) If both [A] and [B] are doubled, rate increases by 2³ = 8 times. Units of rate constant k: For an nth-order reaction, k has units of (concentration)^(1-n) × (time)^(-1). For third order: k has units M^(-2)s^(-1) or L²mol^(-2)s^(-1). Example: For the reaction 2NO + O₂ → 2NO₂, experimental rate law is Rate = k[NO]²[O₂], making it third order overall (second order in NO, first order in O₂). Important: Order must be determined experimentally - it cannot be deduced from the stoichiometric equation alone.'

  question: 'A reaction has the rate law: Rate = k[A]^0.5[B]². What happens to the rate if [A] is increased by a factor of 4 and [B] is doubled?'
  options:
  - Rate increases by factor of 4
  - Rate increases by factor of 8
  - Rate increases by factor of 16
  - Rate increases by factor of 32
  correct_answer: Rate increases by factor of 8
  explanation: 'For Rate = k[A]^0.5[B]², we need to calculate the effect of changing concentrations. Initial rate: R₁ = k[A]₁^0.5[B]₁². Final rate: R₂ = k[A]₂^0.5[B]₂², where [A]₂ = 4[A]₁ and [B]₂ = 2[B]₁. Calculating: R₂ = k(4[A]₁)^0.5(2[B]₁)² = k × 4^0.5 × [A]₁^0.5 × 2² × [B]₁² = k × 2 × [A]₁^0.5 × 4 × [B]₁² = 8 × k[A]₁^0.5[B]₁² = 8R₁. Therefore, the rate increases by a factor of 8. Breaking it down: (1) Increasing [A] by factor of 4: Since order with respect to A is 0.5, rate increases by 4^0.5 = 2 times. (2) Increasing [B] by factor of 2: Since order with respect to B is 2, rate increases by 2² = 4 times. (3) Combined effect: 2 × 4 = 8 times increase in rate. This example shows fractional order (0.5 with respect to A), which indicates a complex mechanism. Fractional orders often arise from multi-step reactions with intermediate species. The overall order is 0.5 + 2 = 2.5, meaning this is a 2.5-order reaction overall.'
