  # Catalysis, Reaction Mechanisms and Temperature Effects

  ## Catalysis

  A **catalyst** is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. Catalysts work by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy.

  ### Key Properties of Catalysts

  - Not consumed in the reaction
  - Effective in small amounts
  - Specific to particular reactions
  - Do not change equilibrium position, only rate
  - Lower activation energy (Ea)

  ## Types of Catalysis

  ### 1. Homogeneous Catalysis

  The catalyst and reactants are in the same phase (usually liquid or gas).

  **Example:** Acid catalysis of ester hydrolysis
  ```
  CH₃COOCH₃ + H₂O → CH₃COOH + CH₃OH
  (Catalyst: H⁺)
  ```

  ### 2. Heterogeneous Catalysis

  The catalyst and reactants are in different phases (typically solid catalyst with gas/liquid reactants).

  **Examples:**
  - Haber process: Fe catalyst for N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃
  - Contact process: V₂O₅ catalyst for SO₂ oxidation
  - Catalytic converters: Pt/Pd/Rh for exhaust gases

  ### 3. Enzyme Catalysis

  Biological catalysts (proteins) that are highly specific and efficient.

  **Characteristics:**
  - Extremely specific (lock and key model)
  - Work under mild conditions
  - Can be inhibited or activated
  - Follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics

  ## Reaction Mechanisms

  A **reaction mechanism** is the step-by-step sequence of elementary reactions that lead to the overall reaction.

  ### Elementary Steps

  - **Unimolecular:** A → Products (rate = k[A])
  - **Bimolecular:** A + B → Products (rate = k[A][B])
  - **Termolecular:** Rare, involves three molecules simultaneously

  ### Rate-Determining Step

  The slowest step in a mechanism determines the overall reaction rate. The rate law must match experimental observations.

  **Example Mechanism:**
  ```
  Step 1 (slow): NO₂ + NO₂ → NO₃ + NO
  Step 2 (fast): NO₃ + CO → NO₂ + CO₂
  Overall: NO₂ + CO → NO + CO₂
  ```

  Rate = k[NO₂]² (from the slow step)

  ## Temperature Effects: Arrhenius Equation

  The Arrhenius equation relates rate constant to temperature:

  **k = A·e^(-Ea/RT)**

  Where:
  - k = rate constant
  - A = pre-exponential factor (frequency factor)
  - Ea = activation energy (J/mol)
  - R = gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K)
  - T = absolute temperature (K)

  ### Logarithmic Form

  ```
  ln k = ln A - (Ea/R)(1/T)
  ```

  This gives a linear plot of ln k vs. 1/T with slope = -Ea/R

  ### Temperature Coefficient

  Most reactions roughly double in rate for every 10°C temperature increase.

  ## How Catalysts Work

  1. **Adsorption** (for heterogeneous): Reactants bind to catalyst surface
  2. **Reaction** occurs at catalyst active sites with lower Ea
  3. **Desorption**: Products leave the catalyst surface
  4. **Regeneration**: Catalyst is ready for next cycle

  ## Energy Profile

  - Uncatalyzed reaction: Higher activation energy
  - Catalyzed reaction: Lower activation energy pathway
  - Both paths have same ΔH (thermodynamics unchanged)

  ## Industrial Applications

  - Ammonia synthesis (Haber process)
  - Sulfuric acid production (Contact process)
  - Petroleum cracking
  - Catalytic converters in automobiles
  - Pharmaceutical synthesis

  - type: mcq
    question: "In the Arrhenius equation k = A·e^(-Ea/RT), what happens to the rate constant k when temperature increases?"
    options:
      - "k decreases exponentially"
      - "k increases exponentially"
      - "k remains constant"
      - "k increases linearly"
    correct_answer: "k increases exponentially"
    explanation: "As temperature T increases, the exponent -Ea/RT becomes less negative, causing e^(-Ea/RT) to increase, and thus k increases exponentially."
