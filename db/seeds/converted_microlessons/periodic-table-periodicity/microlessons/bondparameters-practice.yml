  Bond length decreases with increasing bond order. Triple bonds are shortest, single
  bonds are longest. C≡C (1.20 Å) < C=C (1.34 Å) < C-C (1.54 Å).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which carbon-carbon bond is the shortest?
  options:
  - C-C (single bond)
  - C=C (double bond)
  - C≡C (triple bond)
  - All are equal
  correct_answer: C≡C (triple bond)
  explanation: "Bond length decreases with increasing bond order. Triple bonds are shortest, single bonds are longest. C≡C (1.20 Å) < C=C (1.34 Å) < C-C (1.54 Å). Higher bond order means more electrons between atoms, pulling them closer together."

  question: As bond order increases, bond energy
  options:
  - increases
  - decreases
  - remains constant
  - first increases then decreases
  correct_answer: increases
  explanation: "Bond energy increases with bond order because more electrons are shared between atoms, making the bond stronger. C≡C (839 kJ/mol) > C=C (614 kJ/mol) > C-C (348 kJ/mol). Stronger bonds require more energy to break."

  question: Which factor does NOT affect bond length?
  options:
  - Bond order
  - Size of atoms
  - Electronegativity difference
  - Color of the compound
  correct_answer: Color of the compound
  explanation: "Bond length is affected by: (1) Bond order - higher order means shorter bond, (2) Size of atoms - larger atoms form longer bonds, (3) Electronegativity - affects bond polarity and can influence bond length. Color of a compound is determined by electronic transitions and does not affect bond length."
