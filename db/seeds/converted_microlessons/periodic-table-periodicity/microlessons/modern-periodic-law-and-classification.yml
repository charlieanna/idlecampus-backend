  \ Law and Classification\n\n    ## Modern Periodic Law\n\n    **Statement**: \"\
  The physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic functions of their\
  \ atomic numbers.\"\n\n    This was proposed by Henry Moseley (1913) and replaced\
  \ Mendeleev's periodic law based on atomic mass.\n\n    ## Structure of Modern Periodic\
  \ Table\n\n    ### Periods (Horizontal Rows)\n    - **7 periods** numbered 1 to\
  \ 7\n    - Period number = Number of shells/energy levels\n    - Example: Na (Period\
  \ 3) has 3 shells: K, L, M\n\n    ### Groups (Vertical Columns)\n    - **18 groups**\
  \ numbered 1 to 18 (IUPAC)\n    - Group number indicates valence electrons (for\
  \ main group elements)\n    - Example: Group 1 = 1 valence electron (alkali metals)\n\
  \n    ## Block Classification\n\n    Elements are classified into four blocks based\
  \ on the subshell being filled:\n\n    ### s-Block Elements\n    - Groups 1 and\
  \ 2\n    - ns¹ and ns² configurations\n    - Includes alkali metals and alkaline\
  \ earth metals\n    - Highly reactive metals\n\n    ### p-Block Elements\n    -\
  \ Groups 13 to 18\n    - ns²np¹⁻⁶ configurations\n    - Includes metals, metalloids,\
  \ and non-metals\n    - Most diverse block\n\n    ### d-Block Elements (Transition\
  \ Elements)\n    - Groups 3 to 12\n    - (n-1)d¹⁻¹⁰ns¹⁻² configurations\n    - All\
  \ are metals\n    - Show variable oxidation states\n\n    ### f-Block Elements (Inner\
  \ Transition Elements)\n    - Lanthanoids: 4f series (58-71)\n    - Actinoids: 5f\
  \ series (90-103)\n    - (n-2)f¹⁻¹⁴(n-1)d⁰⁻¹ns² configurations\n\n    ## Metallic\
  \ and Non-metallic Character\n\n    ### Metallic Character\n    - **Increases**\
  \ down a group (easier to lose electrons)\n    - **Decreases** across a period (harder\
  \ to lose electrons)\n    - Metals are on the left and bottom of the periodic table\n\
  \n    ### Non-metallic Character\n    - **Decreases** down a group\n    - **Increases**\
  \ across a period\n    - Non-metals are on the right and top of the periodic table\n\
  \n    ### Metalloids/Semi-metals\n    - Elements with intermediate properties\n\
  \    - Examples: B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te, Po, At\n    - Form a diagonal line separating\
  \ metals from non-metals\n\n    ## Key Points for IIT JEE\n\n    1. Modern periodic\
  \ law is based on **atomic number**, not atomic mass\n    2. Period number = Number\
  \ of shells\n    3. Group number (1-2, 13-18) = Valence electrons\n    4. Transition\
  \ elements (d-block) show variable oxidation states\n    5. Metallic character increases\
  \ down and left; non-metallic increases up and right\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Modern\
  \ periodic law\n\n- Periods and groups\n\n- Block classification"
