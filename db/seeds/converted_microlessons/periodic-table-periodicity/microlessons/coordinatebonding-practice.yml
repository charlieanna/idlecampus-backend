  Coordinate bonds form when one atom donates both electrons. NH₄⁺ has N→H⁺ coordinate
  bond. Metal complexes like [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ have NH₃→Cu²⁺ coordinate bonds. H₂O and
  CH₄ have only normal covalent bonds.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following contain coordinate bonds?
  options:
  - NH₄⁺ and [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺
  - H₂O and CH₄
  - NaCl and KBr
  - O₂ and N₂
  correct_answer: NH₄⁺ and [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺
  explanation: "Coordinate bonds form when one atom donates both electrons. NH₄⁺ has an N→H⁺ coordinate bond where nitrogen donates its lone pair to H⁺. Metal complexes like [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ have NH₃→Cu²⁺ coordinate bonds. H₂O and CH₄ have only normal covalent bonds where each atom contributes one electron."

  question: In a coordinate bond, the electron pair is donated by
  options:
  - one atom donates both electrons
  - each atom donates one electron
  - the metal ion
  - the anion
  correct_answer: one atom donates both electrons
  explanation: "In a coordinate (dative) bond, both electrons in the bonding pair come from one atom (the donor). This is different from a normal covalent bond where each atom contributes one electron. The donor must have a lone pair of electrons. Once formed, a coordinate bond is identical to a covalent bond."

  question: Which molecule can act as a donor in coordinate bonding?
  options:
  - NH₃ (has lone pair on N)
  - CH₄ (no lone pairs)
  - BF₃ (electron deficient)
  - H₂ (no lone pairs)
  correct_answer: NH₃ (has lone pair on N)
  explanation: "NH₃ can act as a donor because nitrogen has a lone pair of electrons that can be donated to form a coordinate bond. CH₄ and H₂ have no lone pairs. BF₃ is electron deficient (only 6 electrons around B) and acts as an electron acceptor, not donor."
