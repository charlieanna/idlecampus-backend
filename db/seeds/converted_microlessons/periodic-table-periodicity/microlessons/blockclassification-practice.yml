  S-block elements are Groups 1 and 2 (alkali and alkaline earth metals). Na and Ca
  are s-block; Fe is d-block; Cl is p-block.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which of the following are s-block elements?
  options:
  - Na and Ca
  - Fe and Cu
  - Cl and Br
  - C and N
  correct_answer: Na and Ca
  explanation: "S-block elements are Groups 1 and 2 (alkali and alkaline earth metals). Na (Group 1) and Ca (Group 2) are s-block elements. Fe and Cu are d-block (transition metals), Cl and Br are p-block (halogens), C and N are p-block (non-metals)."

  question: Which block do the noble gases belong to?
  options:
  - s-block
  - p-block
  - d-block
  - f-block
  correct_answer: p-block
  explanation: "Noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn) belong to the p-block as they are in Group 18, the last group of the periodic table. They have completely filled outermost shells (ns² np⁶ configuration, except He which is 1s²)."

  question: Lanthanides and actinides are part of which block?
  options:
  - s-block
  - p-block
  - d-block
  - f-block
  correct_answer: f-block
  explanation: "Lanthanides (Ce to Lu) and actinides (Th to Lr) are f-block elements because their last electron enters the f-orbital. They are also called inner transition elements and are placed separately at the bottom of the periodic table."
