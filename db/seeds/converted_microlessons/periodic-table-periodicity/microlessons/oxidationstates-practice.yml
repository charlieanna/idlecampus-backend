  Let oxidation state of Cr = x. H₂O is neutral. Complex has +3 charge (to balance
  3 Cl⁻). x + 6(0) = +3, so x = +3.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the oxidation state of Cr in [Cr(H₂O)₆]Cl₃?
  options:
  - '+1'
  - '+2'
  - '+3'
  - '+6'
  correct_answer: '+3'
  explanation: "Let oxidation state of Cr = x. H₂O is a neutral ligand (charge = 0). The complex has +3 charge (to balance 3 Cl⁻ outside). So: x + 6(0) = +3, therefore x = +3. This is a common oxidation state for chromium."

  question: What is the oxidation state of Fe in [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻?
  options:
  - '+2'
  - '+3'
  - '+4'
  - '+6'
  correct_answer: '+2'
  explanation: "Let oxidation state of Fe = x. CN⁻ is a monodentate ligand with charge = -1. The complex has -4 charge overall. So: x + 6(-1) = -4, therefore x - 6 = -4, x = +2. This is ferrocyanide ion."

  question: In K₄[Fe(CN)₆], what is the oxidation state of Fe?
  options:
  - '+2'
  - '+3'
  - '+4'
  - '0'
  correct_answer: '+2'
  explanation: "The complex ion is [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻. Let oxidation state of Fe = x. Each CN⁻ has charge -1. So: x + 6(-1) = -4, x = +2. The 4 K⁺ ions balance the -4 charge of the complex. This is potassium ferrocyanide."
