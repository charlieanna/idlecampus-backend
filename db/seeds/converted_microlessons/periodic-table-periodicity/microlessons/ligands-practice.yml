  EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is hexadentate with 2 N and 4 O donor atoms.
  Forms highly stable 6-membered chelate rings due to chelate effect.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the denticity of EDTA?
  options:
  - Monodentate
  - Bidentate
  - Tridentate
  - Hexadentate
  correct_answer: Hexadentate
  explanation: "EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a hexadentate ligand with 6 donor atoms: 2 nitrogen atoms (from -NH- groups) and 4 oxygen atoms (from -COO⁻ carboxylate groups). It forms very stable chelate complexes by wrapping around the metal ion, forming multiple coordinate bonds."

  question: Which of the following is a bidentate ligand?
  options:
  - NH₃
  - en (ethylenediamine)
  - Cl⁻
  - H₂O
  correct_answer: en (ethylenediamine)
  explanation: "Ethylenediamine (en = H₂N-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂) is a bidentate ligand with 2 donor nitrogen atoms. NH₃, Cl⁻, and H₂O are monodentate ligands (one donor atom each). Bidentate ligands form chelate rings, which are more stable than complexes with monodentate ligands."

  question: What is the denticity of a monodentate ligand?
  options:
  - '1'
  - '2'
  - '4'
  - '6'
  correct_answer: '1'
  explanation: "Monodentate ligands have one donor atom and form one coordinate bond with the central metal. Examples include NH₃ (donor: N), H₂O (donor: O), Cl⁻, CN⁻, and CO. The term 'monodentate' means 'one tooth,' indicating a single binding site."
