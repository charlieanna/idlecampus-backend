  IUPAC nomenclature: (1) List ligands alphabetically, (2) add prefixes for multiple
  ligands, (3) name metal with oxidation state, (4) add -ate for anionic complexes.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: In IUPAC nomenclature of coordination compounds, ligands are named
  options:
  - in alphabetical order
  - in order of charge
  - in order of size
  - metal is named first
  correct_answer: in alphabetical order
  explanation: "IUPAC rules: (1) Cation is named before anion, (2) Ligands are listed alphabetically (ignoring prefixes like di-, tri-), (3) Prefixes (di-, tri-, tetra-) indicate number of each ligand, (4) Metal is named with oxidation state in Roman numerals, (5) -ate suffix is added for anionic complexes."

  question: What suffix is used for anionic coordination complexes?
  options:
  - -ate
  - -ite
  - -ide
  - -ium
  correct_answer: -ate
  explanation: "Anionic complexes use the suffix -ate. For example: [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ is ferrate, [Al(OH)₄]⁻ is aluminate. The metal name may change (Fe → ferrate, Cu → cuprate, Au → aurate). Cationic and neutral complexes retain the metal's name without modification."

  question: 'The IUPAC name of [Cu(NH₃)₄]SO₄ is:'
  options:
  - Tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate
  - Copper tetraammine sulfate
  - Sulfate tetraamminecopper
  - Ammine copper sulfate
  correct_answer: Tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate
  explanation: "Following IUPAC rules: (1) Cation [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺ is named first, (2) 4 NH₃ ligands = tetraammine (note: -mmine for NH₃), (3) Cu is in +2 oxidation state (to balance SO₄²⁻), (4) Anion SO₄²⁻ is sulfate. Complete name: Tetraamminecopper(II) sulfate."
