  Primary valence = oxidation state = ionizable bonds. Complex has +3 charge (to balance
  3 Cl⁻), so primary valence = 3.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the primary valence of Cr in [Cr(H₂O)₆]Cl₃?
  options:
  - '1'
  - '2'
  - '3'
  - '6'
  correct_answer: '3'
  explanation: "According to Werner's theory, primary valence = oxidation state = ionizable bonds. The complex [Cr(H₂O)₆]Cl₃ has +3 charge (to balance 3 Cl⁻), so primary valence = 3. This represents the number of negative ions needed to satisfy the charge."

  question: What is the secondary valence (coordination number) in [Cr(H₂O)₆]Cl₃?
  options:
  - '3'
  - '4'
  - '6'
  - '9'
  correct_answer: '6'
  explanation: "According to Werner's theory, secondary valence = coordination number = number of ligands/donor atoms directly bonded to the metal. In [Cr(H₂O)₆]Cl₃, there are 6 H₂O molecules bonded to Cr, so secondary valence = 6. These are non-ionizable bonds."

  question: According to Werner's theory, primary valence is
  options:
  - ionizable and represented by dotted lines
  - non-ionizable and represented by thick lines
  - the coordination number
  - always equal to 6
  correct_answer: ionizable and represented by dotted lines
  explanation: "Werner's postulates: (1) Primary valence is ionizable, satisfied by negative ions, and represented by dotted lines - it equals the oxidation state, (2) Secondary valence is non-ionizable, satisfied by ligands, and represented by thick lines - it equals the coordination number. Primary valence varies depending on the metal's oxidation state."
