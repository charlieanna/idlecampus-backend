  FALSE. Coordination number = number of DONOR ATOMS, not number of ligands. Example:
  [Co(en)₃]³⁺ has 3 ligands but CN = 6 (each en donates 2 atoms).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: The coordination number depends on
  options:
  - the number of ligands
  - the number of donor atoms
  - the charge on the complex
  - the oxidation state of the metal
  correct_answer: the number of donor atoms
  explanation: "Coordination number is the number of DONOR ATOMS bonded to the central metal ion, NOT the number of ligands. For example, [Co(en)₃]³⁺ has 3 ligands (en = ethylenediamine) but CN = 6 because each bidentate en ligand donates 2 atoms."

  question: What is the coordination number in [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺?
  options:
  - '2'
  - '4'
  - '6'
  - '8'
  correct_answer: '4'
  explanation: "In [Cu(NH₃)₄]²⁺, there are 4 NH₃ ligands, and each NH₃ is monodentate (donates 1 donor atom). Therefore, coordination number = 4 × 1 = 4. This complex has a square planar geometry."

  question: What is the coordination number in [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻?
  options:
  - '2'
  - '4'
  - '6'
  - '8'
  correct_answer: '6'
  explanation: "In [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻, there are 6 CN⁻ ligands, and each CN⁻ is monodentate (donates 1 donor atom through C). Therefore, coordination number = 6 × 1 = 6. This complex has an octahedral geometry."
