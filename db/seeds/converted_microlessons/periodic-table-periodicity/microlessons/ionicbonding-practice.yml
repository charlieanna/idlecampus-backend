  Ionic compounds are polar and dissolve in polar solvents (like water) due to ion-dipole
  interactions. They do NOT conduct in solid state (ions are fixed), have HIGH melting
  points, and exist as solids.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'
exercises:
- type: mcq
  sequence_order: 1
  question: Which property is characteristic of ionic compounds?
  options:
  - Conduct electricity in solid state
  - Low melting points
  - Soluble in polar solvents
  - Exist as gases at room temperature
  correct_answer: Soluble in polar solvents
  explanation: "Ionic compounds are soluble in polar solvents (like water) due to strong ion-dipole interactions. Water molecules surround and stabilize the ions through hydration. They do NOT conduct in solid state (ions are fixed), have HIGH melting points (strong electrostatic forces), and exist as solids at room temperature."

  question: Ionic compounds conduct electricity when
  options:
  - in solid state
  - molten or in aqueous solution
  - at low temperature
  - never
  correct_answer: molten or in aqueous solution
  explanation: "Ionic compounds conduct electricity when molten or dissolved in water because ions become mobile and can move to carry charge. In solid state, ions are locked in fixed positions in the crystal lattice and cannot move, so they do not conduct electricity."

  question: Why do ionic compounds have high melting points?
  options:
  - Weak intermolecular forces
  - Strong electrostatic forces between ions
  - Low lattice energy
  - Covalent bonding
  correct_answer: Strong electrostatic forces between ions
  explanation: "Ionic compounds have high melting points due to strong electrostatic forces (ionic bonds) between oppositely charged ions. Large amounts of energy are required to overcome these forces and break the crystal lattice. For example, NaCl melts at 801°C, MgO at 2852°C."
