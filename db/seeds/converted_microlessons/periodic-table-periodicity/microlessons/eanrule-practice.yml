  EAN = Z - oxidation state + 2×CN. Fe oxidation state in [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ is +2. EAN =
  26 - 2 + 2×6 = 36 (same as Kr, noble gas).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: What is the EAN (Effective Atomic Number) of Fe in [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻?
  options:
  - '26'
  - '30'
  - '36'
  - '54'
  correct_answer: '36'
  explanation: "EAN = Z - oxidation state + 2×CN. Fe has Z = 26. In [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻, Fe is in +2 oxidation state and CN = 6. Therefore, EAN = 26 - 2 + 2×6 = 26 - 2 + 12 = 36 (same as Kr, a noble gas). This explains the stability of the complex."

  question: According to the EAN rule, stable complexes have EAN equal to
  options:
  - the atomic number of the metal
  - the atomic number of a noble gas
  - the oxidation state of the metal
  - the coordination number
  correct_answer: the atomic number of a noble gas
  explanation: "The EAN (Effective Atomic Number) rule states that stable metal complexes have an EAN equal to the atomic number of the next noble gas. This is also called the 18-electron rule. The complex achieves a stable noble gas configuration by accepting electrons from ligands."

  question: What is the formula for calculating EAN?
  options:
  - EAN = Z + oxidation state + 2×CN
  - EAN = Z - oxidation state + 2×CN
  - EAN = Z - oxidation state - 2×CN
  - EAN = Z + 2×CN
  correct_answer: EAN = Z - oxidation state + 2×CN
  explanation: "EAN = Z - oxidation state + 2×CN, where Z is the atomic number, oxidation state is the charge on the metal (positive value), and CN is the coordination number. The factor of 2 comes from the fact that each coordinate bond involves a pair of electrons donated by the ligand."
