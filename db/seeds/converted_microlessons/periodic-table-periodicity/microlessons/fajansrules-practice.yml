  Smaller cations have higher charge density (polarizing power) and distort the electron
  cloud of anions more, increasing covalent character. Example: Li⁺ (small) gives
  more covalent compounds than Na⁺ (larger).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: According to Fajans' rules, which cation will give more covalent character to its compounds?
  options:
  - Li⁺ (smaller)
  - Na⁺ (larger)
  - K⁺ (larger)
  - Rb⁺ (larger)
  correct_answer: Li⁺ (smaller)
  explanation: "Smaller cations have higher charge density (polarizing power) and distort the electron cloud of anions more, increasing covalent character. Li⁺ is the smallest alkali metal cation, so LiCl has more covalent character than NaCl, KCl, or RbCl."

  question: Fajans' rules predict that covalent character increases when
  options:
  - cation is small and anion is large
  - cation is large and anion is small
  - both ions are large
  - both ions are small
  correct_answer: cation is small and anion is large
  explanation: "Covalent character increases when: (1) Cation is small (high charge density, high polarizing power), (2) Anion is large (easily polarizable), (3) Cation has high charge, (4) Cation has pseudo-noble gas configuration (d¹⁰ like Cu⁺, Ag⁺). Small cation + large anion maximizes polarization and covalent character."

  question: Which compound has more covalent character according to Fajans' rules?
  options:
  - NaCl
  - NaI
  - Both equal
  - Cannot be determined
  correct_answer: NaI
  explanation: "NaI has more covalent character than NaCl because I⁻ is a larger anion (more polarizable) than Cl⁻. According to Fajans' rules, larger anions are more easily polarized by cations, leading to greater distortion of the electron cloud and increased covalent character."
