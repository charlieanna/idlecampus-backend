  Group number for p-block = 10 + valence electrons. Group 15 = 10 + 5 = 15 valence
  electrons. Alternatively, Group 15 elements (pnictogens) have 5 valence electrons
  (ns²np³).


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: An element is in Group 15 and Period 3. How many valence electrons does it have?
  options:
  - '3'
  - '5'
  - '7'
  - '15'
  correct_answer: '5'
  explanation: "Group 15 elements (pnictogens: N, P, As, Sb, Bi) have 5 valence electrons with electronic configuration ns² np³. For p-block elements, the number of valence electrons = Group number - 10. So Group 15 = 15 - 10 = 5 valence electrons. The element in Group 15, Period 3 is phosphorus (P)."

  question: How many valence electrons do Group 2 elements have?
  options:
  - '1'
  - '2'
  - '4'
  - '8'
  correct_answer: '2'
  explanation: "Group 2 elements (alkaline earth metals: Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra) have 2 valence electrons with electronic configuration ns². These are s-block elements. They readily lose 2 electrons to form +2 cations."

  question: Which group has 7 valence electrons?
  options:
  - Group 7
  - Group 17
  - Group 14
  - Group 1
  correct_answer: Group 17
  explanation: "Group 17 (halogens: F, Cl, Br, I, At) have 7 valence electrons with configuration ns² np⁵. For p-block elements, valence electrons = Group number - 10 = 17 - 10 = 7. They need one more electron to complete their octet, making them highly reactive."
