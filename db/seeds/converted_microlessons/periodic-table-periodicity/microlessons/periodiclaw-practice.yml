  Modern periodic law (Moseley, 1913) states that properties are periodic functions
  of atomic number, not atomic mass.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Modern periodic law is based on which property of elements?
  options:
  - Atomic mass
  - Atomic number
  - Atomic volume
  - Density
  correct_answer: Atomic number
  explanation: "The Modern Periodic Law (proposed by Henry Moseley in 1913) states: 'The physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic number (Z).' This replaced Mendeleev's law based on atomic mass. Atomic number determines electronic configuration, which determines chemical properties."

  question: Who proposed the Modern Periodic Law?
  options:
  - Mendeleev
  - Moseley
  - Newlands
  - Dobereiner
  correct_answer: Moseley
  explanation: "Henry Moseley proposed the Modern Periodic Law in 1913 based on atomic number. Mendeleev proposed the original periodic law in 1869 based on atomic mass. Newlands proposed the Law of Octaves, and Dobereiner proposed the Law of Triads."

  question: Why was Mendeleev's periodic law modified?
  options:
  - Some elements were out of order by atomic mass
  - Isotopes have different masses but same properties
  - Both of the above
  - It was never modified
  correct_answer: Both of the above
  explanation: "Mendeleev's law (based on atomic mass) had anomalies: (1) Some pairs were out of order (Ar-K, Co-Ni, Te-I) where properties didn't match mass order, (2) Isotopes have different masses but identical chemical properties. Moseley's law based on atomic number resolved these issues."
