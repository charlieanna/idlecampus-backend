  # First Law of Thermodynamics

  ## Introduction

  The **First Law of Thermodynamics** is essentially the law of conservation of energy applied to thermodynamic systems. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another.

  ## Statement of the First Law

  **ΔU = Q - W**

  Where:
  - **ΔU** = Change in internal energy of the system
  - **Q** = Heat added to the system
  - **W** = Work done by the system

  **Alternative form:**
  ΔU = Q + W (when W is work done ON the system)

  ## Understanding the Terms

  ### Internal Energy (U)

  - Total energy contained within a system
  - Includes kinetic and potential energy of molecules
  - **State function** - depends only on current state, not path taken
  - For ideal gas: U depends only on temperature

  ### Heat (Q)

  - Energy transferred due to temperature difference
  - **Sign conventions:**
    - Q > 0: Heat absorbed by system (endothermic)
    - Q < 0: Heat released by system (exothermic)
  - **Path function** - depends on how process occurs

  ### Work (W)

  - Energy transferred through organized motion
  - For gases: W = ∫P dV (pressure-volume work)
  - **Sign conventions:**
    - W > 0: Work done by system (expansion)
    - W < 0: Work done on system (compression)
  - **Path function** - depends on process

  ## Sign Conventions Summary

  | Process | Q | W | ΔU |
  |---------|---|---|----|
  | Heat absorbed, System expands | + | + | Depends |
  | Heat released, System expands | - | + | Depends |
  | Heat absorbed, System compresses | + | - | Depends |
  | Heat released, System compresses | - | - | Depends |

  ## Special Cases

  ### 1. Isothermal Process (ΔT = 0)

  For ideal gas: ΔU = 0

  Therefore: **Q = W**

  All heat absorbed is converted to work (or vice versa).

  **Example:** Ideal gas expansion/compression at constant temperature
  ```
  ΔU = 0
  Q = W = nRT ln(V₂/V₁)
  ```

  ### 2. Adiabatic Process (Q = 0)

  No heat exchange with surroundings.

  Therefore: **ΔU = -W**

  All work comes from/goes to internal energy.

  **Example:** Rapid compression/expansion
  ```
  Q = 0
  ΔU = -W
  TV^(γ-1) = constant (for ideal gas)
  ```

  ### 3. Isochoric Process (ΔV = 0)

  Constant volume, so no P-V work.

  Therefore: **ΔU = Q** (W = 0)

  All heat changes internal energy.

  **Example:** Heating gas in rigid container
  ```
  W = 0
  ΔU = Q = nCᵥΔT
  ```

  ### 4. Isobaric Process (ΔP = 0)

  Constant pressure.

  **ΔU = Q - W**

  Where W = PΔV

  **Example:** Heating gas in cylinder with movable piston
  ```
  W = PΔV = nRΔT
  Q = nCₚΔT
  ΔU = nCᵥΔT
  ```

  ## Practical Examples

  ### Example 1: Gas Expansion

  **Problem:** 2 moles of ideal gas expands isothermally at 300K from 10L to 20L. Calculate Q, W, and ΔU.

  **Solution:**
  - Isothermal ⟹ ΔU = 0
  - W = nRT ln(V₂/V₁) = 2 × 8.314 × 300 × ln(2) = 3457 J
  - Q = W = 3457 J (heat absorbed)

  ### Example 2: Adiabatic Compression

  **Problem:** A gas is compressed adiabatically, doing 500 J of work on it. Find ΔU and Q.

  **Solution:**
  - Adiabatic ⟹ Q = 0
  - Work done ON system ⟹ W = -500 J
  - ΔU = Q - W = 0 - (-500) = 500 J (internal energy increases)

  ### Example 3: Constant Volume Heating

  **Problem:** 1 mole of gas at constant volume absorbs 750 J of heat. Cᵥ = 20.8 J/(mol·K). Find ΔT and ΔU.

  **Solution:**
  - Isochoric ⟹ W = 0, so ΔU = Q = 750 J
  - ΔT = Q/nCᵥ = 750/(1 × 20.8) = 36.1 K

  ## Cyclic Processes

  For a complete cycle (returns to initial state):

  **ΔU_cycle = 0**

  Therefore: **Q_cycle = W_cycle**

  Net heat absorbed equals net work done.

  ## Applications

  1. **Heat engines** - Convert heat to work
  2. **Refrigerators** - Transfer heat from cold to hot
  3. **Biological systems** - Energy metabolism
  4. **Industrial processes** - Chemical reactors, power plants

  ## Important Relationships

  **For ideal gas:**
  - Cₚ - Cᵥ = R (Mayer's relation)
  - γ = Cₚ/Cᵥ (heat capacity ratio)
  - ΔU = nCᵥΔT (always, any process)

  **Work in various processes:**
  - Isothermal: W = nRT ln(V₂/V₁)
  - Isobaric: W = PΔV = nRΔT
  - Isochoric: W = 0
  - Adiabatic: W = (P₁V₁ - P₂V₂)/(γ - 1)

  ## Key Takeaways

  1. **Energy is conserved** - First law is energy conservation
  2. **ΔU is a state function** - Depends only on initial and final states
  3. **Q and W are path functions** - Depend on how process occurs
  4. **Sign conventions matter** - Be consistent!
  5. **Different processes** have different relationships between Q, W, and ΔU
