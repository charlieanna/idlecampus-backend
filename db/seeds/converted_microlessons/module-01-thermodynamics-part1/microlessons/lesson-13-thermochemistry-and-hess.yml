  # Thermochemistry and Hess's Law

  ## Introduction

  **Thermochemistry** is the study of heat changes during chemical reactions. Understanding energy changes helps predict reaction spontaneity, calculate energy requirements, and design efficient processes.

  ## Enthalpy (H)

  **Enthalpy** is the heat content of a system at constant pressure.

  **Change in enthalpy:**
  ΔH = H_products - H_reactants

  - **ΔH < 0**: Exothermic (heat released)
  - **ΔH > 0**: Endothermic (heat absorbed)

  **Relationship to internal energy:**
  ΔH = ΔU + PΔV

  At constant pressure: ΔH = Q_p (heat at constant pressure)

  ## Thermochemical Equations

  Chemical equations that include enthalpy changes.

  **Examples:**
  ```
  C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g)     ΔH = -393.5 kJ
  N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) → 2NH₃(g)  ΔH = -92.4 kJ
  H₂O(l) → H₂O(g)           ΔH = +44.0 kJ
  ```

  **Important notes:**
  - ΔH depends on:
    - States of matter (s, l, g, aq)
    - Temperature and pressure (usually 25°C, 1 atm)
    - Amount of substance (coefficients matter!)

  ## Types of Enthalpy Changes

  ### 1. Enthalpy of Formation (ΔH_f°)

  Heat change when 1 mole of compound is formed from its elements in standard states.

  **Standard state:** Pure form at 1 atm, 25°C

  **Examples:**
  ```
  C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g)           ΔH_f° = -393.5 kJ/mol
  H₂(g) + ½O₂(g) → H₂O(l)         ΔH_f° = -285.8 kJ/mol
  ½N₂(g) + ³⁄₂H₂(g) → NH₃(g)      ΔH_f° = -46.1 kJ/mol
  ```

  **Note:** ΔH_f° for elements in standard state = 0
  (e.g., O₂(g), N₂(g), H₂(g), C(s, graphite))

  ### 2. Enthalpy of Combustion (ΔH_c°)

  Heat released when 1 mole of substance undergoes complete combustion.

  **Examples:**
  ```
  CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)  ΔH_c° = -890.3 kJ/mol
  C₆H₁₂O₆(s) + 6O₂(g) → 6CO₂(g) + 6H₂O(l)  ΔH_c° = -2808 kJ/mol
  ```

  ### 3. Enthalpy of Neutralization (ΔH_n°)

  Heat change when an acid and base react to form 1 mole of water.

  **Example:**
  ```
  HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l)  ΔH_n° = -57.3 kJ/mol
  ```

  For strong acid + strong base: ΔH_n° ≈ -57 kJ/mol (constant)

  ## Hess's Law

  **Statement:** The total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same, regardless of the pathway taken.

  **Principle:** Enthalpy is a state function - depends only on initial and final states, not the path.

  ### Why Hess's Law Works

  If a reaction can occur by multiple routes:
  ```
  Route 1: A → B directly        ΔH₁
  Route 2: A → C → B             ΔH₂ + ΔH₃
  ```

  Then: **ΔH₁ = ΔH₂ + ΔH₃**

  ### Using Hess's Law

  **Rules for manipulating thermochemical equations:**

  1. **Reverse equation:** Change sign of ΔH
     ```
     If: A → B    ΔH = x
     Then: B → A  ΔH = -x
     ```

  2. **Multiply equation:** Multiply ΔH by same factor
     ```
     If: A → B       ΔH = x
     Then: 2A → 2B   ΔH = 2x
     ```

  3. **Add equations:** Add ΔH values
     ```
     A → B   ΔH₁ = x
     B → C   ΔH₂ = y
     _______________
     A → C   ΔH = x + y
     ```

  ## Hess's Law Example

  **Problem:** Calculate ΔH for: C(s) + ½O₂(g) → CO(g)

  **Given:**
  ```
  (1) C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g)        ΔH₁ = -393.5 kJ
  (2) CO(g) + ½O₂(g) → CO₂(g)      ΔH₂ = -283.0 kJ
  ```

  **Solution:**
  - Keep equation (1) as is
  - Reverse equation (2):  CO₂(g) → CO(g) + ½O₂(g)   ΔH = +283.0 kJ
  - Add:
  ```
  C(s) + O₂(g) → CO₂(g)              ΔH = -393.5 kJ
  CO₂(g) → CO(g) + ½O₂(g)            ΔH = +283.0 kJ
  ________________________________
  C(s) + ½O₂(g) → CO(g)              ΔH = -110.5 kJ
  ```

  ## Calculating ΔH from Formation Enthalpies

  **Formula:**
  ΔH°_reaction = Σ ΔH_f°(products) - Σ ΔH_f°(reactants)

  **Example:** Calculate ΔH for:
  ```
  CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(l)
  ```

  **Given:**
  - ΔH_f°[CH₄(g)] = -74.8 kJ/mol
  - ΔH_f°[CO₂(g)] = -393.5 kJ/mol
  - ΔH_f°[H₂O(l)] = -285.8 kJ/mol
  - ΔH_f°[O₂(g)] = 0 (element)

  **Solution:**
  ```
  ΔH° = [1(-393.5) + 2(-285.8)] - [1(-74.8) + 2(0)]
      = [-393.5 - 571.6] - [-74.8]
      = -965.1 + 74.8
      = -890.3 kJ
  ```

  ## Practical Applications

  1. **Predicting reaction energies** when direct measurement is difficult
  2. **Calculating formation enthalpies** of unstable compounds
  3. **Fuel efficiency** calculations
  4. **Industrial process optimization**
  5. **Biochemical reactions** (metabolism, photosynthesis)

  ## Born-Haber Cycle

  Special application of Hess's Law for ionic compound formation.

  **Example: Formation of NaCl**
  ```
  Na(s) + ½Cl₂(g) → NaCl(s)  ΔH_f°

  Can be broken down into:
  Na(s) → Na(g)                 (sublimation)
  Na(g) → Na⁺(g) + e⁻           (ionization)
  ½Cl₂(g) → Cl(g)               (bond dissociation)
  Cl(g) + e⁻ → Cl⁻(g)           (electron affinity)
  Na⁺(g) + Cl⁻(g) → NaCl(s)     (lattice energy)
  ```

  ## Key Points

  1. **Enthalpy is a state function** - path independent
  2. **Hess's Law** allows calculation of unmeasurable ΔH values
  3. **Standard enthalpies of formation** are reference values
  4. **Thermochemical equations** must include states and conditions
  5. **Conservation of energy** underlies all calculations

  ## Common Mistakes to Avoid

  1. Forgetting to reverse ΔH when reversing equations
  2. Not multiplying ΔH when scaling equations
  3. Ignoring states of matter
  4. Forgetting that ΔH_f° for elements = 0
  5. Sign errors in calculations
