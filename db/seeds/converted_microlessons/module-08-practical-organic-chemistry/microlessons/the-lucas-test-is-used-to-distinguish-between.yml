  Lucas test (ZnCl₂ in HCl) distinguishes alcohols based on reactivity: Tertiary (immediate
  turbidity) > Secondary (5-10 min) > Primary (no reaction). Based on SN1 mechanism.


  ## Key Points

  question: 'The Lucas test is used to distinguish between:'
  options:
  - Aldehydes and ketones
  - Primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols
  - Phenols and alcohols
  - Carboxylic acids and esters
  correct_answer: Primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols
  explanation: "The Lucas test (using Lucas reagent: ZnCl₂ in concentrated HCl) is used to distinguish between primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols based on their reactivity via the SN1 mechanism. Tertiary alcohols react immediately, producing turbidity (cloudiness) due to formation of insoluble alkyl chloride. Secondary alcohols produce turbidity in 5-10 minutes. Primary alcohols (and methanol) do not react at room temperature, remaining clear. The order of reactivity (3° > 2° > 1°) follows carbocation stability in the SN1 mechanism. This test works best for alcohols with 6 or fewer carbons due to solubility considerations."
