  High Rf means the compound moves far with the solvent, indicating it is less polar
  (weak interaction with polar silica gel). Polar compounds have low Rf as they stick
  to the stationary phase.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: 'In TLC, a compound with high Rf value indicates that it is:'
  options:
  - Very polar
  - Less polar
  - Ionic
  - Insoluble
  correct_answer: Less polar
  explanation: "In Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), a compound with a high Rf (retention factor) value indicates that it is less polar. The Rf value is calculated as (distance traveled by compound)/(distance traveled by solvent). A high Rf means the compound moved far with the mobile phase (solvent), indicating weak interaction with the polar stationary phase (typically silica gel, SiO₂). Less polar compounds have weaker adsorption to the polar silica, so they move more freely. Conversely, polar compounds have strong interactions with silica and remain closer to the origin (low Rf). This principle is based on 'like dissolves like' - polar compounds stick to polar stationary phase."
