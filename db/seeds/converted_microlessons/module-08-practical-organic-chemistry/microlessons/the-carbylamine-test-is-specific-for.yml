  question: 'The carbylamine test is specific for:'
  options:
  - All amines
  - Primary amines only
  - Secondary amines only
  - Tertiary amines only
  correct_answer: Primary amines only
  explanation: "The carbylamine test (isocyanide test) is specific for primary amines only. When heated with chloroform (CHCl₃) and alcoholic KOH, primary amines produce isocyanides (carbylamine, R-N≡C) which have an extremely foul, characteristic odor. Secondary and tertiary amines do not give this reaction because they lack the necessary -NH₂ group required for the mechanism. This makes it a definitive test to identify and distinguish primary amines from secondary and tertiary amines."
