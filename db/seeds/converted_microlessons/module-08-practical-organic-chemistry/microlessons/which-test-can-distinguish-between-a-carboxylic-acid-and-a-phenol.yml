  NaHCO₃ reacts only with carboxylic acids (stronger acids) producing CO₂ effervescence.
  Phenols (weaker acids) do NOT react with NaHCO₃ but react with NaOH.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which test can distinguish between a carboxylic acid and a phenol?
  options:
  - FeCl₃ test
  - NaOH test
  - NaHCO₃ test
  - Bromine water test
  correct_answer: NaHCO₃ test
  explanation: "The NaHCO₃ (sodium bicarbonate) test can effectively distinguish between carboxylic acids and phenols. Carboxylic acids (stronger acids, pKa ~4-5) react with NaHCO₃ to form carboxylate salts and release CO₂ gas (visible effervescence), while phenols (weaker acids, pKa ~10) do not react with the weak base NaHCO₃. Both carboxylic acids and phenols react with NaOH, making it non-selective. The FeCl₃ test is specific for phenols but doesn't distinguish from carboxylic acids effectively."
