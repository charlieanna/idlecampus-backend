  question: Which test gives a silver mirror with aldehydes?
  options:
  - Tollens' test
  - Iodoform test
  - Fehling's test
  - 2,4-DNP test
  correct_answer: Tollens' test
  explanation: "Tollens' test (silver mirror test) gives a characteristic silver mirror with aldehydes. The test uses Tollens' reagent [Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺ (ammoniacal silver nitrate solution), which is a mild oxidizing agent. Aldehydes reduce Ag⁺ to metallic silver (Ag⁰), which deposits as a shiny silver mirror on the inner surface of the test tube: RCHO + 2[Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺ + 3OH⁻ → RCOO⁻ + 2Ag↓ + 4NH₃ + 2H₂O. Ketones do not give this test (except α-hydroxy ketones). The iodoform test is for methyl ketones/alcohols, and 2,4-DNP test gives orange precipitate with both aldehydes and ketones (not a silver mirror)."
