  CaCl₂ reacts with alcohols and amines forming complexes, so it should not be used.
  Na₂SO₄ or MgSO₄ are suitable for drying alcohols as they are neutral and unreactive.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: Which drying agent should NOT be used for drying alcohols?
  options:
  - Na₂SO₄
  - MgSO₄
  - CaCl₂
  - K₂CO₃
  correct_answer: CaCl₂
  explanation: "CaCl₂ (calcium chloride) should NOT be used for drying alcohols because it reacts with alcohols and amines to form addition compounds/complexes, making it unsuitable. For example, CaCl₂ forms CaCl₂·ROH complexes with alcohols, which interferes with the purification process. Suitable drying agents for alcohols include anhydrous Na₂SO₄ (sodium sulfate) and MgSO₄ (magnesium sulfate), which are neutral, non-reactive, and effectively remove water without reacting with the organic compound. K₂CO₃ can also be used but is more suitable for neutral or basic compounds."
