  Phenol forms a colored complex [Fe(OAr)₃] with FeCl₃, giving violet, blue, or green
  color depending on the phenol. This is a characteristic test for phenolic compounds.


  ## Key Points

  question: 'Phenol reacts with neutral FeCl₃ to give:'
  options:
  - Red precipitate
  - Violet/blue/green color
  - Silver mirror
  - Yellow precipitate
  correct_answer: Violet/blue/green color
  explanation: "Phenol reacts with neutral FeCl₃ (ferric chloride) to form a colored complex [Fe(OC₆H₅)₆]³⁻, producing a characteristic violet, blue, or green coloration depending on the specific phenolic compound and concentration. This is a diagnostic test for phenolic compounds (-OH group directly attached to aromatic ring). The color arises from the formation of a coordination complex between Fe³⁺ and the phenoxide ion. Alcohols do not give this test, making it specific for phenols."
