  Distillation separates liquids based on differences in their boiling points. Simple
  distillation is used when bp difference >25°C, fractional distillation when <25°C.


  ## Key Points

  question: Which purification technique is based on differences in boiling points
    of liquids?
  options:
  - Crystallization
  - Distillation
  - Sublimation
  - Chromatography
  correct_answer: Distillation
  explanation: "Distillation is the purification technique based on differences in boiling points of liquids. It involves heating a liquid mixture to vaporize the more volatile component (lower boiling point), then condensing the vapor back to liquid in a separate container. Simple distillation is used when the boiling point difference is greater than 25°C. Fractional distillation is used when the boiling point difference is less than 25°C, using a fractionating column for better separation. Other techniques work differently: crystallization uses solubility differences, sublimation is solid-to-gas transition, and chromatography uses differential adsorption/partitioning."
