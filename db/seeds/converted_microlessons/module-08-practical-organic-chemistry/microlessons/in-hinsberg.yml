  - Forms a colored complex
  correct_answer: Soluble in KOH
  explanation: "In the Hinsberg test, primary amines react with benzenesulfonyl chloride (C₆H₅SO₂Cl) to form sulfonamides (C₆H₅SO₂-NH-R) that have an acidic hydrogen. This acidic hydrogen allows the product to be deprotonated by KOH, making it soluble in the base. Secondary amines form insoluble sulfonamides without acidic hydrogen, while tertiary amines don't react at all. This differential solubility in KOH is the basis for distinguishing between primary, secondary, and tertiary amines."
