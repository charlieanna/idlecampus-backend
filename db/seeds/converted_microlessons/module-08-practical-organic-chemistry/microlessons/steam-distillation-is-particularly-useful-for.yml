  Steam distillation is used for heat-sensitive, water-immiscible organic compounds.
  It allows distillation below the normal boiling point of the compound, preventing
  decomposition. Example: aniline.

  correct_answer: Purifying heat-sensitive, water-immiscible compounds
  explanation: "Steam distillation is particularly useful for purifying heat-sensitive, water-immiscible organic compounds. It allows distillation at temperatures below the normal boiling point of the compound (typically below 100°C at atmospheric pressure), preventing thermal decomposition of heat-sensitive materials. The technique works because the total vapor pressure equals the sum of individual vapor pressures, allowing the mixture to boil below either component's boiling point. Examples include extraction of essential oils, purification of aniline, and isolation of natural products that would decompose at their normal boiling points."
