  Nitrogen is detected by forming Prussian blue (Fe₄[Fe(CN)₆]₃) when sodium fusion
  extract is treated with FeSO₄ and H₂SO₄. The nitrogen converts to NaCN during fusion.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  correct_answer: Formation of Prussian blue precipitate with FeSO₄
  explanation: "In Lassaigne's test for nitrogen detection, the organic compound is fused with sodium metal, converting nitrogen to sodium cyanide (NaCN). When the sodium fusion extract is treated with freshly prepared FeSO₄ (ferrous sulfate) and then acidified with H₂SO₄, nitrogen is detected by the formation of Prussian blue precipitate [Fe₄[Fe(CN)₆]₃] or ferric ferrocyanide. The reaction sequence: N → NaCN → Na₄[Fe(CN)₆] → Fe₄[Fe(CN)₆]₃ (Prussian blue). The characteristic blue-green to blue color confirms the presence of nitrogen in the organic compound."
