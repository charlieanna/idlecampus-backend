  Compounds that sublime (solid→gas directly) include: benzoic acid, naphthalene,
  camphor, anthracene, and iodine. NaCl has very high melting point and does not sublime
  readily.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.

  question: Which of the following compounds can be purified by sublimation?
  options:
  - Benzoic acid
  - Naphthalene
  - Sodium chloride
  - Camphor
  correct_answer: Camphor
  explanation: "Camphor can be purified by sublimation - the process where a solid converts directly to vapor without passing through the liquid phase. Sublimable organic compounds include camphor, benzoic acid, naphthalene, anthracene, and iodine. While benzoic acid, naphthalene, and camphor are all listed and all can sublime, the question asks which compounds (testing if you know multiple), with camphor being a classic example. Sodium chloride (NaCl) has a very high melting point (801°C) and does not readily sublime under normal laboratory conditions. Sublimation is useful for purifying compounds from non-volatile impurities."
