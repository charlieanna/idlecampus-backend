  question: Fehling\
  options:
  - All aldehydes and ketones
  - Aliphatic aldehydes only
  - Aromatic aldehydes only
  - All ketones
  correct_answer: Aliphatic aldehydes only
  explanation: "Fehling's test (or Benedict's test) gives a positive result with aliphatic aldehydes only, producing a brick-red precipitate of Cu₂O. Aliphatic aldehydes can reduce the Cu²⁺ (blue) in Fehling's solution to Cu⁺ (red precipitate). Aromatic aldehydes like benzaldehyde do not give a positive Fehling's test because the carbonyl group is less reactive due to resonance stabilization with the benzene ring. Ketones generally do not reduce Fehling's reagent (except α-hydroxy ketones). This makes Fehling's test useful for distinguishing aliphatic aldehydes from aromatic aldehydes and ketones."
