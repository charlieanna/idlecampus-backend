  NaHCO₃ (weak base) reacts with stronger acids like benzoic acid (RCOOH) but NOT
  with weaker acids like phenol (ArOH). Benzoic acid dissolves in aqueous NaHCO₃ layer,
  phenol stays in organic layer.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  - Ether
  correct_answer: NaHCO₃
  explanation: "NaHCO₃ (sodium bicarbonate) is a weak base that can distinguish between benzoic acid and phenol based on their relative acidities. Benzoic acid (pKa ~4.2) is a stronger acid and reacts with NaHCO₃ to form sodium benzoate, which dissolves in the aqueous layer with CO₂ evolution. Phenol (pKa ~10) is a much weaker acid and does not react with the weak base NaHCO₃, remaining in the organic layer. Both would dissolve in stronger bases like NaOH, making NaHCO₃ the selective reagent for separation."
