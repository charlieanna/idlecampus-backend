  Swarts reaction specifically prepares fluoroalkanes: R-Cl + AgF → R-F + AgCl or
  R-Cl + SbF₃ → R-F + SbCl₃. Named after Belgian chemist Frédéric Swarts.


  ## Key Points

  question: 'Swarts reaction is used for the preparation of:'
  options:
  - Chloroalkanes
  - Bromoalkanes
  - Fluoroalkanes
  - Iodoalkanes
  correct_answer: Fluoroalkanes
  explanation: "The Swarts reaction specifically prepares fluoroalkanes from chloro or bromoalkanes using reagents like AgF, SbF₃, or Hg₂F₂. For example: R-Cl + AgF → R-F + AgCl. This reaction is named after Belgian chemist Frédéric Swarts. Fluorine's high electronegativity and the strength of the C-F bond make direct fluorination difficult, so this halogen exchange method is important for preparing organofluorine compounds."

  question: Which reagent is used to convert alcohols to alkyl chlorides?
  options:
  - PCl₅ or SOCl₂
  - AgCl
  - HCl only
  - Cl₂/UV
  correct_answer: PCl₅ or SOCl₂
  explanation: "Alcohols are converted to alkyl chlorides using reagents like PCl₅ (phosphorus pentachloride), PCl₃ (phosphorus trichloride), or SOCl₂ (thionyl chloride). For example: R-OH + PCl₅ → R-Cl + POCl₃ + HCl, or R-OH + SOCl₂ → R-Cl + SO₂ + HCl. SOCl₂ is particularly useful because the byproducts (SO₂ and HCl) are gases and escape, making purification easier. Simple HCl is too weak to convert alcohols directly (requires ZnCl₂ catalyst in Lucas reagent), and Cl₂/UV is used for free radical halogenation of alkanes, not alcohols."

  question: How are alkyl bromides prepared from alcohols?
  options:
  - Using HBr or PBr₃
  - Using Br₂/UV light
  - Using NaBr in water
  - Using Br₂/FeBr₃
  correct_answer: Using HBr or PBr₃
  explanation: "Alkyl bromides are prepared from alcohols using HBr or PBr₃ (phosphorus tribromide). With HBr: R-OH + HBr → R-Br + H₂O (often with H₂SO₄ catalyst). With PBr₃: 3R-OH + PBr₃ → 3R-Br + H₃PO₃. PBr₃ is preferred for primary alcohols as it avoids carbocation rearrangements. Br₂/UV is for free radical halogenation of alkanes. NaBr in water won't work (needs acidic conditions). Br₂/FeBr₃ is for aromatic bromination, not preparing alkyl bromides from alcohols."
