  Vicinal dihalides have two halogens on adjacent carbons. CH₂Cl-CH₂Cl is 1,2-dichloroethane
  (vicinal). CH₃CHCl₂ is geminal (same carbon). CH₂Cl₂ has only one carbon.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which compound is a vicinal dihalide?
  options:
  - CH₂Cl₂
  - CH₃CHCl₂
  - CH₂Cl-CH₂Cl
  - CHCl₃
  correct_answer: CH₂Cl-CH₂Cl
  explanation: "Vicinal dihalides have two halogen atoms on adjacent (neighboring) carbon atoms. CH₂Cl-CH₂Cl (1,2-dichloroethane) is a vicinal dihalide because the two chlorine atoms are on carbons 1 and 2. CH₃CHCl₂ is a geminal dihalide (both halogens on the same carbon). CH₂Cl₂ has only one carbon so it cannot be vicinal. CHCl₃ has three halogens on one carbon."

  question: What is a geminal dihalide?
  options:
  - Two halogens on adjacent carbons
  - Two halogens on the same carbon
  - Two different halogens in the molecule
  - Two halogens separated by two carbons
  correct_answer: Two halogens on the same carbon
  explanation: "A geminal dihalide has two halogen atoms attached to the same carbon atom. The term 'geminal' comes from the Latin word 'geminus' meaning twin. An example is CH₃CHCl₂ (1,1-dichloroethane) where both chlorine atoms are on carbon 1. This is different from vicinal dihalides where the two halogens are on adjacent carbons (like 1,2-dichloroethane)."

  question: How are haloalkanes classified based on the carbon bearing the halogen?
  options:
  - Primary, secondary, tertiary based on number of halogens
  - Primary, secondary, tertiary based on carbon hybridization
  - Primary, secondary, tertiary based on number of carbons attached to halogen-bearing carbon
  - Primary, secondary, tertiary based on total number of carbons
  correct_answer: Primary, secondary, tertiary based on number of carbons attached to halogen-bearing carbon
  explanation: "Haloalkanes are classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°), or tertiary (3°) based on the number of carbon atoms directly attached to the carbon bearing the halogen. Primary has one carbon attached (e.g., CH₃CH₂-Cl), secondary has two carbons attached (e.g., (CH₃)₂CH-Cl), and tertiary has three carbons attached (e.g., (CH₃)₃C-Cl). This classification is important because it affects reactivity in substitution and elimination reactions."
