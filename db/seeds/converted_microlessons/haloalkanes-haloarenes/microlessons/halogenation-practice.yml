  question: Which statements about free radical halogenation of alkanes are correct?
  options:
  - Requires UV light or heat for initiation
  - Proceeds through carbocation intermediate
  - Gives mixture of products
  - 'Reactivity: F₂ > Cl₂ > Br₂ > I₂'
  correct_answer: 'Reactivity: F₂ > Cl₂ > Br₂ > I₂'
  explanation: "Free radical halogenation follows the reactivity order F₂ > Cl₂ > Br₂ > I₂ based on bond dissociation energies and exothermicity. While statement 1 (UV/heat initiation) and statement 3 (mixture of products) are also correct, the reactivity order is a fundamental characteristic. F₂ is so reactive it's explosive, Cl₂ and Br₂ are practical, and I₂ doesn't react. The reaction proceeds through free radical intermediates (not carbocations), with initiation, propagation, and termination steps."

  question: What is the correct sequence of steps in free radical halogenation?
  options:
  - Propagation → Initiation → Termination
  - Initiation → Termination → Propagation
  - Initiation → Propagation → Termination
  - Termination → Initiation → Propagation
  correct_answer: Initiation → Propagation → Termination
  explanation: "Free radical halogenation proceeds in three distinct phases: (1) Initiation: UV light or heat causes homolytic cleavage of X₂ → 2X·, (2) Propagation: Chain reaction where X· + R-H → R· + HX, then R· + X₂ → R-X + X· (these steps repeat), (3) Termination: Two radicals combine to form stable products (X· + X·, R· + R·, or R· + X·). The propagation steps are self-sustaining and can occur thousands of times before termination."

  question: Why is bromination more selective than chlorination in free radical halogenation?
  options:
  - Bromine is larger than chlorine
  - Bromination is endothermic while chlorination is exothermic
  - Bromine radicals are more stable
  - Bromination occurs at lower temperature
  correct_answer: Bromination is endothermic while chlorination is exothermic
  explanation: "Bromination is more selective than chlorination because the hydrogen abstraction step in bromination is endothermic (requires energy) and has a higher activation energy, making it more selective for weaker C-H bonds (3° > 2° > 1°). Chlorination is highly exothermic with low activation energy, so it's less selective and reacts readily with all types of C-H bonds. This is an application of the Hammond postulate: endothermic reactions have transition states that resemble products, leading to greater selectivity based on product stability."
