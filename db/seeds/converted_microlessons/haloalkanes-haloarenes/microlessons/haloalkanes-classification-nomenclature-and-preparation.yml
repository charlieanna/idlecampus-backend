  \n\n# Haloalkanes (Alkyl Halides)\n\n    ## Introduction\n\n    **Haloalkanes**\
  \ are organic compounds in which one or more hydrogen atoms of an alkane are replaced\
  \ by halogen atoms (F, Cl, Br, I).\n\n    **General formula:** R-X (where X = F,\
  \ Cl, Br, I)\n\n    **Examples:**\n    - CH₃Cl (Methyl chloride)\n    - CH₃CH₂Br\
  \ (Ethyl bromide)\n    - CH₃CHBrCH₃ (Isopropyl bromide)\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Classification\

  \ #### Di-haloalkanes (2 halogens)\n    - CH₂Cl₂ (Dichloromethane)\n    - CH₂Br-CH₂Br\
  \ (1,2-Dibromoethane)\n\n    **Geminal dihalides:** Two halogens on same carbon\

  \ Primary (1°) Haloalkanes\n    - Halogen attached to **primary carbon** (carbon\
  \ bonded to one other carbon)\n    - **Example:** CH₃CH₂-Cl (Ethyl chloride)\n\n\
  \    ```\n    CH₃-CH₂-X\n         ↑\n      Primary carbon\n    ```\n\n    #### Secondary\

  \ carbon chain** containing halogen\n    2. **Number the chain** to give halogen\
  \ lowest number\n    3. **Name halogens** as prefixes: fluoro-, chloro-, bromo-,\
  \ iodo-\n    4. **Alphabetical order** if multiple halogens\n    5. **Use di-, tri-,\
  \ tetra-** for multiple identical halogens\n\n    ### Examples:\n\n    | Structure\

  \n    #### Effect of Halogen\n    ```\n    R-I > R-Br > R-Cl > R-F\n    (Increasing\
  \ molecular weight and van der Waals forces)\n    ```\n\n    #### Effect of Chain\
  \ Length\n    - **Longer chain → Higher boiling point**\n    - More surface area\
  \ → stronger van der Waals forces\n\n    #### Effect of Branching\n    - **More\
  \ branching → Lower boiling point**\n    - Less surface contact\n\n    **Example:**\n\
  \    - n-Butyl chloride (78°C) > Isobutyl chloride (69°C) > tert-Butyl chloride\
  \ (51°C)\n\n    ### 3. Solubility\n    - **Insoluble in water** (non-polar, cannot\
  \ form H-bonds)\n    - **Soluble in organic solvents** (like dissolves like)\n \
  \   - Heavier than water (except some fluoroalkanes)\n\n    ### 4. Density\n   \
  \ - **Increases with:** Molecular weight, number of halogens\n    - **Order:** R-I\

  \    ```\n    R-OH + SOCl₂ → R-Cl + SO₂↑ + HCl↑\n    ```\n\n    **Advantages:**\n\

  \ obtained**\n    - Works for all alcohols\n\n    ### Method 2: Halogenation of\
  \ Alkanes\n    ```\n    R-H + X₂ --[UV light or heat]--> R-X + HX\n    ```\n\n \

  \ Propagation: R-H + X· → R· + HX\n                 R· + X₂ → R-X + X·\n    Termination:\
  \ R· + R· → R-R\n                 X· + X· → X₂\n                 R· + X· → R-X\n\

  \ 3: Addition to Alkenes\n\n    #### (a) Addition of HX (Markovnikov)\n    ```\n\
  \    R-CH=CH₂ + HX → R-CHX-CH₃\n    ```\n\n    **Markovnikov's rule:** H goes to\
  \ carbon with more H atoms\n\n    **Example:**\n    ```\n    CH₃-CH=CH₂ + HBr →\
  \ CH₃-CHBr-CH₃ (major)\n    ```\n\n    #### (b) Addition of X₂\n    ```\n    R-CH=CH₂\
  \ + X₂ → R-CHX-CH₂X (vicinal dihalide)\n    ```\n\n    **Example:**\n    ```\n \
  \   CH₂=CH₂ + Br₂ → CH₂Br-CH₂Br (1,2-dibromoethane)\n    ```\n\n    ### Method 4:\
  \ Hunsdiecker Reaction\n    ```\n    R-COOAg + Br₂ → R-Br + CO₂ + AgBr\n    ```\n\

    question: "Which of the following methods is considered the BEST for preparing pure alkyl chlorides from alcohols?"
    options:
      - "Reaction with HCl and ZnCl₂ (Lucas reagent)"
      - "Reaction with PCl₅"
      - "Reaction with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂)"
      - "Reaction with PCl₃"
    correct_answer: "Reaction with thionyl chloride (SOCl₂)"
    explanation: "Thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) is the best method for preparing pure alkyl chlorides from alcohols because the byproducts formed (SO₂ and HCl) are both gases that escape easily from the reaction mixture, leaving behind the pure product. The reaction is: R-OH + SOCl₂ → R-Cl + SO₂↑ + HCl↑. In contrast, other methods like PCl₅ and PCl₃ produce byproducts like POCl₃ and H₃PO₃ which are liquids and difficult to separate. This makes SOCl₂ the preferred reagent for obtaining the purest alkyl chloride product. The gaseous byproducts eliminate the need for extensive purification steps, making this method both efficient and practical for laboratory and industrial synthesis."

    question: "Arrange the following haloalkanes in order of INCREASING boiling point: CH₃F, CH₃Cl, CH₃Br, CH₃I"
    options:
      - "CH₃I < CH₃Br < CH₃Cl < CH₃F"
      - "CH₃F < CH₃Cl < CH₃Br < CH₃I"
      - "CH₃Cl < CH₃F < CH₃Br < CH₃I"
      - "CH₃F < CH₃Br < CH₃Cl < CH₃I"
    correct_answer: "CH₃F < CH₃Cl < CH₃Br < CH₃I"
    explanation: "The boiling point of haloalkanes increases with increasing molecular weight and size of the halogen atom. This trend is due to increasing van der Waals forces (London dispersion forces) as the molecular mass increases. Fluorine is the smallest and lightest halogen, so CH₃F has the lowest boiling point. As we move down the halogen group (F → Cl → Br → I), the atomic size and molecular weight increase significantly. Iodine is the largest and heaviest, making CH₃I have the highest boiling point. The increasing electron cloud size in larger halogens also leads to greater polarizability, which strengthens intermolecular forces. Therefore, the correct order is CH₃F < CH₃Cl < CH₃Br < CH₃I, with boiling points approximately -78°C, -24°C, 3.6°C, and 42.4°C respectively."

    question: "A compound with molecular formula C₄H₉Br shows two geminal bromines on the same carbon atom. What is its IUPAC name?"
    options:
      - "2,2-Dibromobutane"
      - "1,1-Dibromobutane"
      - "2-Bromo-2-methylpropane"
      - "This structure cannot exist (C₄H₉Br cannot have geminal dibromides)"
    correct_answer: "This structure cannot exist (C₄H₉Br cannot have geminal dibromides)"
    explanation: "This question tests the understanding of molecular formulas and structural possibilities. The molecular formula C₄H₉Br indicates a monobromoalkane (only ONE bromine atom). Geminal dibromides have two bromine atoms attached to the same carbon atom (e.g., -CHBr₂-), which would require at least TWO bromine atoms in the molecular formula, giving C₄H₈Br₂ for a geminal dibromide. Since the given formula contains only one bromine atom (C₄H₉Br), it is impossible for this compound to have geminal bromines. This is an important concept in organic chemistry: the molecular formula must be consistent with the proposed structure. A compound like 1,1-dibromobutane would have the formula C₄H₈Br₂, not C₄H₉Br. Understanding this relationship between molecular formula and structure is crucial for solving structural problems in organic chemistry."
