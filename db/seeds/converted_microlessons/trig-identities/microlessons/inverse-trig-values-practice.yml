  question: What is the principal value of sin⁻¹(1/2)?
  options:
  - π/6
  - π/3
  - π/4
  - 5π/6
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: π/6
  explanation: 'The principal value of sin⁻¹(1/2) is π/6 (or 30°). The principal
    value range for sin⁻¹(x) is [-π/2, π/2], which includes only angles in quadrants
    I and IV. Since sin(π/6) = 1/2 and π/6 is in the principal range, sin⁻¹(1/2)
    = π/6. Note: While sin(5π/6) = 1/2 as well, 5π/6 is NOT in the principal range
    of sin⁻¹, so it''s not the answer. Common values to remember: sin⁻¹(0) = 0, sin⁻¹(1/2)
    = π/6, sin⁻¹(√2/2) = π/4, sin⁻¹(√3/2) = π/3, sin⁻¹(1) = π/2.'

  question: What is the range (principal value) of cos⁻¹(x)?
  options:
  - '[-π/2, π/2]'
  - '[0, π]'
  - '[-π, π]'
  - '[0, 2π]'
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: '[0, π]'
  explanation: 'The principal value range of cos⁻¹(x) is [0, π], which includes angles
    in quadrants I and II. This is different from sin⁻¹(x) which has range [-π/2,
    π/2]. The range [0, π] ensures that each value of x in domain [-1, 1] maps to
    exactly one angle. Examples: cos⁻¹(1) = 0, cos⁻¹(√3/2) = π/6, cos⁻¹(1/2) = π/3,
    cos⁻¹(0) = π/2, cos⁻¹(-1/2) = 2π/3, cos⁻¹(-1) = π. For tan⁻¹(x), the range is
    (-π/2, π/2). These ranges are chosen to make inverse trig functions single-valued
    (functions must pass vertical line test).'

  question: 'Calculate: sin⁻¹(√3/2) + cos⁻¹(√3/2)'
  options:
  - π/2
  - π/3
  - π/6
  - π
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: π/2
  explanation: 'sin⁻¹(√3/2) + cos⁻¹(√3/2) = π/3 + π/6 = π/2. Calculation: sin⁻¹(√3/2)
    = π/3 (since sin(π/3) = √3/2 and π/3 is in range [-π/2, π/2]), cos⁻¹(√3/2) =
    π/6 (since cos(π/6) = √3/2 and π/6 is in range [0, π]). Sum = π/3 + π/6 = 2π/6
    + π/6 = 3π/6 = π/2. This follows the general identity: sin⁻¹(x) + cos⁻¹(x) =
    π/2 for all x ∈ [-1, 1]. Proof: Let sin⁻¹(x) = θ, then x = sin(θ). So cos(π/2
    - θ) = sin(θ) = x, which means cos⁻¹(x) = π/2 - θ = π/2 - sin⁻¹(x). Similar
    identity: tan⁻¹(x) + cot⁻¹(x) = π/2.'
