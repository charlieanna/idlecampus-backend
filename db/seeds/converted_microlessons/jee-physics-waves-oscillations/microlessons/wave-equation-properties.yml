  # Wave Equation and Properties

  ## What is a Wave?

  **Disturbance that transfers energy** without transferring matter.

  ## Types of Waves

  ### 1. Mechanical Waves:
  - Require medium (solid, liquid, gas)
  - Examples: Sound, water waves, seismic waves

  ### 2. Electromagnetic Waves:
  - Don't require medium
  - Examples: Light, radio, X-rays

  ### 3. Based on Particle Motion:
  - **Transverse:** Particle motion ⊥ wave propagation (light, string)
  - **Longitudinal:** Particle motion ∥ wave propagation (sound)

  ## Wave Parameters

  ```
  Amplitude (A): Maximum displacement from mean position
  Wavelength (λ): Distance between consecutive crests/troughs
  Frequency (f): Number of oscillations per second (Hz)
  Time Period (T): Time for one complete oscillation
  Wave Speed (v): Distance traveled per unit time
  ```

  ### Relations:
  ```
  f = 1/T
  v = fλ = λ/T
  ```

  ## Progressive Wave Equation

  ### Wave traveling in +x direction:
  ```
  y(x,t) = A sin(kx - ωt + φ)

  OR equivalently:
  y(x,t) = A sin(ωt - kx + φ)    [opposite convention]
  ```

  ### Wave traveling in -x direction:
  ```
  y(x,t) = A sin(kx + ωt + φ)
  ```

  ### Parameters:
  ```
  k = wave number = 2π/λ (rad/m)
  ω = angular frequency = 2πf = 2π/T (rad/s)
  φ = initial phase
  ```

  ## Alternative Forms

  ```
  y = A sin(ωt - kx)           [standard]
  y = A sin 2π(t/T - x/λ)      [using T, λ]
  y = A sin(ω(t - x/v))        [using wave speed]
  y = A cos(kx - ωt)           [cosine form]
  ```

  ## Phase and Phase Difference

  ### Phase:
  ```
  φ_total = kx - ωt + φ₀

  Phase determines position in oscillation cycle
  ```

  ### Phase Difference:
  Between two points separated by Δx:
  ```
  Δφ = kΔx = (2π/λ)Δx

  Δx = λ → Δφ = 2π (same phase)
  Δx = λ/2 → Δφ = π (opposite phase)
  ```

  Between two times separated by Δt:
  ```
  Δφ = ωΔt = (2π/T)Δt
  ```

  ## Particle Velocity vs Wave Velocity

  ### Wave Velocity:
  ```
  v_wave = ω/k = λf = constant (for given medium)
  ```

  ### Particle Velocity:
  ```
  v_particle = ∂y/∂t = -Aω cos(kx - ωt)

  Maximum particle velocity: v_max = Aω
  ```

  ### Important:
  ```
  v_particle = -v_wave × (∂y/∂x)

  Particle velocity ≠ wave velocity!
  ```

  ## Wave Speed in Different Media

  ### String:
  ```
  v = √(T/μ)

  T = tension
  μ = mass per unit length (linear density)
  ```

  ### Sound in Gas:
  ```
  v = √(γP/ρ) = √(γRT/M)

  γ = ratio of specific heats
  P = pressure, ρ = density
  T = temperature (Kelvin)
  ```

  ### Sound in Solid:
  ```
  v = √(Y/ρ)

  Y = Young's modulus
  ```

  ## Energy in Waves

  ### Energy Density:
  ```
  u = ½ρω²A²

  ρ = density of medium
  ```

  ### Power (Energy per unit time):
  ```
  P = ½ρω²A²v × Area

  P ∝ A²f² (for given medium)
  ```

  ### Intensity:
  ```
  I = P/A = ½ρω²A²v

  I ∝ A² (intensity proportional to square of amplitude)
  ```

  ## Superposition Principle

  When two waves overlap:
  ```
  y_net = y₁ + y₂

  Results: Interference, standing waves, beats
  ```

  ## Numerical Examples

  **Example 1:** Wave equation y = 5 sin(4πx - 20πt). Find amplitude, wavelength, frequency, wave speed.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  Comparing with y = A sin(kx - ωt):
  A = 5 cm
  k = 4π, so λ = 2π/k = 2π/4π = 0.5 m
  ω = 20π, so f = ω/2π = 20π/2π = 10 Hz
  T = 1/f = 0.1 s
  v = ω/k = 20π/4π = 5 m/s

  OR v = fλ = 10 × 0.5 = 5 m/s ✓
  ```

  **Example 2:** String of length 2 m has mass 10 g under tension 200 N. Find wave speed.

  **Solution:**
  ```
  μ = m/L = 10×10⁻³/2 = 5×10⁻³ kg/m
  v = √(T/μ) = √(200/5×10⁻³)
  v = √(40000) = 200 m/s
  ```

  **Example 3:** Two points on wave are separated by λ/3. Phase difference is?

  **Solution:**
  ```
  Δφ = (2π/λ) × Δx = (2π/λ) × (λ/3) = 2π/3 rad = 120°

  Points are 1/3 cycle apart in oscillation.
  ```

  ## JEE Key Points

  1. **v = fλ = ω/k** (fundamental relation)
  2. **Phase difference** Δφ = (2π/λ)Δx
  3. **Particle velocity ≠ Wave velocity**
  4. **I ∝ A²** (intensity square of amplitude)
  5. **String:** v = √(T/μ)
  6. **Sound:** v = √(γRT/M)

  question: "Wave equation y = 0.02 sin(500t - 50x) in SI units. Wave velocity is:"
  options:
  - "10 m/s"
  - "50 m/s"
  - "500 m/s"
  - "25000 m/s"
  correct_answer: "10 m/s"
  explanation: "From equation: ω = 500 rad/s, k = 50 rad/m. Wave velocity v = ω/k = 500/50 = 10 m/s. Alternative: λ = 2π/k = 2π/50 m, f = ω/2π = 500/2π Hz. v = fλ = (500/2π)(2π/50) = 10 m/s ✓. Common mistake: Using individual values like v = 500 or v = 50. The wave speed is ratio ω/k, not individual parameters. Also note: amplitude A = 0.02 m = 2 cm. Direction: +x (since sign between x and t is negative). Maximum particle velocity = Aω = 0.02 × 500 = 10 m/s (coincidentally equals wave speed here)."

  question: "If tension in string is increased 4 times keeping other factors same, wave speed:"
  options:
  - "Doubles"
  - "Halves"
  - "Becomes 4 times"
  - "Remains same"
  correct_answer: "Doubles"
  explanation: "For string: v = √(T/μ). If T' = 4T: v' = √(4T/μ) = 2√(T/μ) = 2v. Speed doubles! Since v ∝ √T, quadrupling tension only doubles speed (square root relationship). This principle is used in musical instruments: tightening guitar string increases tension, increases wave speed, increases frequency (for same wavelength = 2L), raises pitch. Conversely, to halve wave speed, reduce tension to 1/4. For string of same material but double diameter: μ increases 4 times (∝ area), so v decreases by factor 2."

  question: "Two waves of same amplitude and frequency but phase difference π/2 superpose. Resultant amplitude is:"
  options:
  - "0"
  - "A"
  - "A√2"
  - "2A"
  correct_answer: "A√2"
  explanation: "For superposition of two waves with phase difference φ: A_resultant = √(A₁² + A₂² + 2A₁A₂cos φ). Here A₁ = A₂ = A, φ = π/2. A_R = √(A² + A² + 2A²cos(π/2)) = √(2A² + 0) = A√2. When φ = 0 (in phase): A_R = 2A (constructive). When φ = π (opposite phase): A_R = 0 (destructive). When φ = π/2 (quadrature): A_R = A√2 (intermediate). This formula is crucial for interference calculations. Intensity ratio: I_R/I = (A_R/A)² = 2. So intensity doubles when two equal waves with 90° phase difference combine."
