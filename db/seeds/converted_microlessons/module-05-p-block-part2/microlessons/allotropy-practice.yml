  White phosphorus (P₄) is most reactive, poisonous, glows in dark, and catches fire
  at 35°C. Must be stored under water.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which allotrope of phosphorus is the most reactive?
  options:
  - White phosphorus
  - Red phosphorus
  - Black phosphorus
  - All equally reactive
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: White phosphorus
  explanation: 'White phosphorus (P₄) is the most reactive allotrope of phosphorus
    due to its high angular strain in the tetrahedral P₄ molecule (60° bond angles
    vs preferred 90°). Key characteristics: (1) **Reactivity**: Catches fire spontaneously
    in air at ~35°C, must be stored under water, (2) **Chemiluminescence**: Glows
    in the dark due to slow oxidation, (3) **Toxicity**: Highly poisonous, (4) **Structure**:
    Discrete P₄ tetrahedra held by weak van der Waals forces. In contrast: Red phosphorus
    is polymeric network, less reactive, non-poisonous, doesn''t glow; Black phosphorus
    is the most stable allotrope with layered structure. The conversion: White P →
    Red P (heating at 250°C without air) → Black P (heating under high pressure).'
