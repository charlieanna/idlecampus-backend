  Xenon forms the most compounds (XeF₂, XeF₄, XeF₆, XeO₃, XeO₄, XeOF₄). It has lower
  ionization energy and larger size than lighter noble gases.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which noble gas forms the most compounds?
  options:
  - Helium
  - Neon
  - Argon
  - Xenon
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Xenon
  explanation: 'Xenon forms the most compounds among noble gases, including XeF₂,
    XeF₄, XeF₆, XeO₃, XeO₄, XeOF₄, and others. This is because: (1) **Low ionization
    energy**: Xenon has the lowest ionization energy among stable noble gases (easy
    to remove outer electrons), (2) **Large atomic size**: Outer electrons are far
    from nucleus and weakly held, making them available for bonding, (3) **Empty d-orbitals**:
    Can accommodate additional electrons for expanded octet. The reactivity trend
    in noble gases: He < Ne < Ar << Kr < Xe < Rn. Helium and neon form no compounds.
    Argon forms very few unstable compounds. Krypton forms KrF₂. Xenon compounds are
    stable enough for practical study. Radon would form even more compounds but is
    intensely radioactive with short half-life.'
