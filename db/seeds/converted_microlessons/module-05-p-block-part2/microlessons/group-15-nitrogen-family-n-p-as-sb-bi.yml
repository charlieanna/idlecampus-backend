  question: "Why does nitrogen (N) not form pentahalides like NCl₅, while phosphorus (P) can form compounds like PCl₅?"
  options:
  - "Nitrogen is less electronegative than phosphorus"
  - "Nitrogen lacks d-orbitals and cannot expand its octet beyond 8 electrons"
  - "Nitrogen forms weaker bonds with halogens"
  - "Nitrogen pentahalides are too unstable due to high reactivity"
  correct_answer: "Nitrogen lacks d-orbitals and cannot expand its octet beyond 8 electrons"
  explanation: "The inability of nitrogen to form pentahalides is a fundamental consequence of its electronic configuration. Nitrogen is a second-period element with the configuration [He] 2s² 2p³, having only 2s and 2p orbitals available in its valence shell. The octet rule limits nitrogen to a maximum of 8 valence electrons, which corresponds to a maximum covalency of 4 (as in NH₄⁺). To form NCl₅, nitrogen would need to accommodate 10 electrons in its valence shell, requiring d-orbitals for orbital expansion. However, nitrogen has no d-orbitals in its valence shell (the 3d orbitals are too high in energy). In contrast, phosphorus is a third-period element [Ne] 3s² 3p³ with accessible 3d orbitals that can participate in bonding. This allows phosphorus to expand its octet and form compounds like PCl₅, where phosphorus uses sp³d hybridization to accommodate 10 valence electrons. This is a classic example of how the availability of d-orbitals distinguishes the chemistry of second-period elements from third-period and heavier elements."

  question: "What is the brown ring test used to detect, and what compound is responsible for the brown color?"
  options:
  - "Detection of NH₃, brown ring is Fe(NH₃)₆²⁺"
  - "Detection of NO₃⁻, brown ring is [Fe(H₂O)₅(NO)]²⁺"
  - "Detection of NO₂⁻, brown ring is Fe(NO₂)₃"
  - "Detection of PO₄³⁻, brown ring is FePO₄"
  correct_answer: "Detection of NO₃⁻, brown ring is [Fe(H₂O)₅(NO)]²⁺"
  explanation: "The brown ring test is a classic qualitative analysis test for detecting nitrate ions (NO₃⁻) in solution. The test is performed by adding freshly prepared ferrous sulfate (FeSO₄) solution to the test solution, followed by carefully layering concentrated sulfuric acid along the sides of the test tube. If nitrate ions are present, a brown ring forms at the junction of the two liquids. The chemistry behind this involves the reduction of nitrate to nitric oxide (NO) by Fe²⁺ in acidic conditions: NO₃⁻ + 3Fe²⁺ + 4H⁺ → NO + 3Fe³⁺ + 2H₂O. The nitric oxide then forms a coordination complex with Fe²⁺: Fe²⁺ + NO → [Fe(H₂O)₅(NO)]²⁺. This complex ion is brown in color and creates the characteristic brown ring. The test is highly sensitive and specific for nitrates, though nitrites can also give a similar response and must be absent for conclusive results. This test demonstrates important concepts in coordination chemistry and redox reactions."

  question: "Why is white phosphorus stored under water?"
  options:
  - "To prevent it from dissolving in air"
  - "To increase its reactivity"
  - "To prevent spontaneous combustion as it catches fire at 35°C in air"
  - "To maintain its white color"
  correct_answer: "To prevent spontaneous combustion as it catches fire at 35°C in air"
  explanation: "White phosphorus (P₄) must be stored under water because it is extremely reactive and pyrophoric—it spontaneously ignites in air at temperatures as low as 35°C (just slightly above room temperature). The P₄ molecules have a tetrahedral structure with significant ring strain due to the 60° P-P-P bond angles, which makes the molecule highly reactive and unstable. When exposed to air, white phosphorus rapidly oxidizes in a highly exothermic reaction: P₄ + 5O₂ → P₄O₁₀, releasing enough heat to sustain combustion. The reaction produces a brilliant white flame and dense white fumes of P₄O₁₀. Storing white phosphorus under water prevents contact with atmospheric oxygen, eliminating the fire hazard. White phosphorus is also highly toxic, causing severe burns on contact with skin. In contrast, red phosphorus (a polymeric form) is much more stable, non-toxic, and does not ignite until heated to about 260°C. This dramatic difference in reactivity between allotropes demonstrates how molecular structure profoundly affects chemical properties."
