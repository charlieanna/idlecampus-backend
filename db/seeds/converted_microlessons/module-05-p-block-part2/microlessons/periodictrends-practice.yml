  Fluorine is the most electronegative element (electronegativity = 4.0 on Pauling
  scale). It has the highest tendency to attract electrons.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'

  question: Which element is the most electronegative in the periodic table?
  options:
  - Oxygen
  - Fluorine
  - Chlorine
  - Nitrogen
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Fluorine
  explanation: 'Fluorine is the most electronegative element in the periodic table
    with an electronegativity value of 4.0 on the Pauling scale. Electronegativity
    is the tendency of an atom to attract electrons towards itself in a chemical bond.
    Fluorine has the highest electronegativity because: (1) It has the smallest atomic
    size in its period, (2) It is only one electron short of achieving stable noble
    gas configuration (Ne), (3) The high effective nuclear charge strongly attracts
    bonding electrons. The electronegativity trend: decreases down a group (F > Cl
    > Br > I) and increases left to right across a period. Order of electronegativity:
    F (4.0) > O (3.5) > N (3.0) > Cl (3.0). Note: Noble gases are not assigned electronegativity
    values as they generally don''t form bonds.'
