  question: "Why are noble gases generally unreactive and exist as monoatomic gases?"
  options:
  - "They have very high electronegativity"
  - "They have complete octet (ns² np⁶) with stable electronic configuration"
  - "They have very low atomic mass"
  - "They form strong metallic bonds"
  correct_answer: "They have complete octet (ns² np⁶) with stable electronic configuration"
  explanation: "Noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn) are exceptionally unreactive because they possess a complete valence shell electronic configuration: ns² np⁶ (except helium which has 1s², also a complete shell). This complete octet represents maximum stability with no tendency to gain, lose, or share electrons. Additionally, noble gases have very high ionization energies (helium has the highest of all elements at 2372 kJ/mol), making it extremely difficult to remove electrons, and near-zero electron affinity, meaning they have no tendency to accept electrons. The stable electronic configuration eliminates the driving force for chemical bonding that exists in other elements. As a result, noble gases exist as isolated monoatomic molecules with only weak van der Waals forces between atoms. This is why they have very low boiling points and exist as gases at room temperature. The discovery that some noble gases (Kr, Xe) can form compounds under extreme conditions (1962, Neil Bartlett's XePtF₆) was revolutionary, but even these compounds require highly electronegative partners like fluorine or oxygen."

  question: "Why can xenon and krypton form compounds while lighter noble gases (He, Ne, Ar) cannot?"
  options:
  - "Xenon and krypton are more electronegative"
  - "Xenon and krypton have lower ionization energy, larger atomic size, and available empty d-orbitals"
  - "Helium and neon are radioactive"
  - "Xenon and krypton have incomplete octets"
  correct_answer: "Xenon and krypton have lower ionization energy, larger atomic size, and available empty d-orbitals"
  explanation: "The ability of xenon and krypton to form stable compounds while lighter noble gases cannot is explained by three key factors. First, ionization energy decreases down the group, so Xe (1170 kJ/mol) and Kr (1351 kJ/mol) have much lower ionization energies compared to He (2372 kJ/mol) or Ne (2081 kJ/mol), making it energetically more feasible to promote electrons for bonding. Second, larger atomic size in Xe and Kr means the valence electrons are farther from the nucleus and less tightly held, making them more accessible for bonding with highly electronegative atoms like fluorine. Third, and crucially, Xe and Kr have empty d-orbitals in their valence shell (4d for Kr, 5d for Xe) that can participate in bonding through orbital expansion beyond the octet, allowing formation of compounds like XeF₂, XeF₄, XeF₆, and KrF₂. In contrast, He and Ne are second-period elements lacking d-orbitals and have much higher ionization energies, making compound formation virtually impossible. The formation of xenon compounds like XeF₂ (linear), XeF₄ (square planar), and XeF₆ (distorted octahedral) demonstrates sp³d, sp³d², and sp³d³ hybridization respectively."

  question: "What happens when XeF₆ undergoes complete hydrolysis?"
  options:
  - "XeF₆ + H₂O → XeO + 6HF"
  - "XeF₆ + 2H₂O → XeO₂ + 4HF"
  - "XeF₆ + 3H₂O → XeO₃ + 6HF"
  - "XeF₆ + 6H₂O → Xe + 6HF + 3O₂"
  correct_answer: "XeF₆ + 3H₂O → XeO₃ + 6HF"
  explanation: "When xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) undergoes complete hydrolysis with water, it produces xenon trioxide (XeO₃) and hydrogen fluoride according to the equation: XeF₆ + 3H₂O → XeO₃ + 6HF. This is different from partial hydrolysis (XeF₄ + 2H₂O → XeO₂ + 4HF). The complete hydrolysis of XeF₆ involves replacement of all six fluorine atoms with oxygen through water molecules. XeO₃ is a powerful explosive compound that is colorless and exists as a crystalline solid. It is highly unstable and dangerous, tending to detonate violently. The product is a strong oxidizing agent. The hydrolysis reaction demonstrates the reactivity of xenon fluorides with water and the tendency of xenon to form oxides. This chemistry is important in understanding noble gas chemistry and the types of compounds that can be formed when traditional inert gases are forced into chemical bonding. The reaction also produces six molecules of HF, which is a weak but corrosive acid that attacks glass."
