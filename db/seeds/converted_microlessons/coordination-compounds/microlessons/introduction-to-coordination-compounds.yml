  question: "What is the oxidation state of cobalt in the complex [Co(NH₃)₅(NO₂)]Cl₂?"
  options:
  - "+2"
  - "+3"
  - "+4"
  - "+1"
  correct_answer: "+3"
  explanation: "To find the oxidation state of the central metal, we use the formula: Charge on complex = Oxidation state + Σ(ligand charges). For [Co(NH₃)₅(NO₂)]Cl₂, first identify the coordination sphere: [Co(NH₃)₅(NO₂)]²⁺ is the complex cation (charge = +2, balanced by 2 Cl⁻ outside). Now analyzing the coordination sphere [Co(NH₃)₅(NO₂)]²⁺: NH₃ is a neutral ligand (charge = 0), and there are 5 of them; NO₂⁻ is an anionic ligand (charge = -1), and there is 1 of it. Using the formula: +2 = x + 5(0) + 1(-1), where x is the oxidation state of Co. Solving: +2 = x - 1, therefore x = +3. The oxidation state of cobalt is +3. This is a common configuration for cobalt in coordination compounds. Note that the oxidation state is written as Co(III) or cobalt(III) in Roman numerals when naming the complex. The ability to calculate oxidation states is crucial for: (1) naming coordination compounds correctly, (2) predicting electronic configuration and magnetic properties, and (3) understanding redox behavior of the complex."

  question: "How many chelate rings are formed in the complex [Co(en)₃]³⁺, where 'en' is ethylenediamine?"
  options:
  - "1"
  - "2"
  - "3"
  - "6"
  correct_answer: "3"
  explanation: "Ethylenediamine (en) is H₂N-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂, a bidentate ligand with two nitrogen donor atoms. When en coordinates to a metal, both nitrogen atoms bond to the same metal center, forming a five-membered chelate ring (including the metal). In [Co(en)₃]³⁺, there are 3 ethylenediamine ligands. Each 'en' ligand forms one chelate ring with the cobalt center. Therefore, total chelate rings = 3. The coordination number is 6 (since 3 bidentate ligands provide 3 × 2 = 6 donor atoms), and the geometry is octahedral. The chelate effect makes this complex much more stable than a similar complex with 6 monodentate amine ligands like [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺. This is because: (1) Entropy increases when a polydentate ligand replaces multiple monodentate ligands (fewer particles → more particles upon dissociation), making ΔG more negative; (2) It's statistically less likely for both ends of a bidentate ligand to dissociate simultaneously. The [Co(en)₃]³⁺ complex is also optically active with d and l enantiomers, as it has no plane of symmetry."

  question: "Which of the following is an ambidentate ligand?"
  options:
  - "NH₃"
  - "NO₂⁻"
  - "en (ethylenediamine)"
  - "Cl⁻"
  correct_answer: "NO₂⁻"
  explanation: "An ambidentate ligand is one that can coordinate to a metal through two different donor atoms (but only one at a time in a given complex). NO₂⁻ (nitrite ion) is a classic ambidentate ligand because it has two possible donor atoms: nitrogen and oxygen. It can bind in two ways: (1) Through nitrogen: M-NO₂ (nitrito-N or nitro), and (2) Through oxygen: M-ONO (nitrito-O or nitrito). This gives rise to linkage isomerism, where [Co(NH₃)₅(NO₂)]²⁺ (yellow, N-bonded) and [Co(NH₃)₅(ONO)]²⁺ (red, O-bonded) are linkage isomers with same formula but different donor atoms. Other examples of ambidentate ligands include: SCN⁻/NCS⁻ (thiocyanate can bond through S or N), and CN⁻/NC⁻ (cyanide can bond through C or N, though C is strongly preferred). In contrast: NH₃ can only donate through N (monodentate, not ambidentate); en has two N donors but both donate simultaneously (bidentate, not ambidentate); Cl⁻ has only one donor atom (monodentate, not ambidentate). Understanding ambidentate ligands is crucial for predicting and explaining isomerism in coordination compounds."
