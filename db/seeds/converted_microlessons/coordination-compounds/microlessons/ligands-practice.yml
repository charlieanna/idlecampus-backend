  EDTA⁴⁻ (ethylenediaminetetraacetate) has 6 donor atoms (2 nitrogen and 4 oxygen),
  making it a hexadentate ligand.


  ## Key Points

  question: EDTA⁴⁻ is an example of which type of ligand?
  options:
  - Hexadentate
  - Bidentate
  - Tridentate
  - Tetradentate
  require_pass: true
  correct_answer: Hexadentate
  explanation: 'EDTA⁴⁻ (ethylenediaminetetraacetate ion) is a hexadentate ligand,
    meaning it can form 6 coordinate bonds with a metal ion using 6 donor atoms. Structure:
    EDTA has 2 nitrogen donor atoms (from two -NH- groups) and 4 oxygen donor atoms
    (from four -COO⁻ carboxylate groups), totaling 6 donor atoms. When EDTA binds
    to a metal ion like Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, or Fe³⁺, it wraps around the metal forming 5 stable
    five-membered chelate rings, creating an extremely stable octahedral complex.
    This is called the "chelate effect" - multidentate ligands form more stable complexes
    than monodentate ligands. Examples of different denticity: Monodentate (1 donor):
    NH₃, Cl⁻, H₂O. Bidentate (2 donors): ethylenediamine (en), oxalate (C₂O₄²⁻). Tridentate
    (3 donors): diethylenetriamine. Hexadentate (6 donors): EDTA. Applications: EDTA
    is used in water softening (binds Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺), complexometric titrations, and
    treating heavy metal poisoning.'
