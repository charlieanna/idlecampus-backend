# Fundamentals of Ecology and Ecosystems

    ## What is Ecology?

    Ecology is the study of relationships between living organisms and their physical environment.

    ## Ecosystem

    ### Definition
    An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with non-living components in their environment.

    ### Components

    #### 1. Biotic Components
    - **Producers (Autotrophs)**: Plants, algae (produce food through photosynthesis)
    - **Consumers (Heterotrophs)**:
      - Primary consumers: Herbivores
      - Secondary consumers: Carnivores
      - Tertiary consumers: Top predators
    - **Decomposers**: Bacteria, fungi (break down dead matter)

    #### 2. Abiotic Components
    - Sunlight, water, air, soil, minerals, temperature

    ## Food Chain and Food Web

    ### Food Chain
    Linear sequence of organisms where nutrients and energy pass from one to another.

    Example:
    ```
    Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake → Eagle
    ```

    ### Food Web
    Interconnected food chains forming a complex network.

    ### Trophic Levels
    - **Level 1**: Producers
    - **Level 2**: Primary consumers
    - **Level 3**: Secondary consumers
    - **Level 4**: Tertiary consumers

    ### 10% Law (Lindeman's Law)
    - Only 10% energy transfers from one trophic level to next
    - 90% lost as heat, respiration, waste

    ## Ecological Pyramids

    ### 1. Pyramid of Numbers
    - Shows number of organisms at each level

    ### 2. Pyramid of Biomass
    - Shows total biomass at each level

    ### 3. Pyramid of Energy
    - Shows energy flow at each level
    - Always upright

    ## Biogeochemical Cycles

    ### 1. Water Cycle (Hydrological Cycle)
    - Evaporation → Condensation → Precipitation → Runoff

    ### 2. Carbon Cycle
    - Atmosphere ↔ Plants (photosynthesis)
    - Plants → Animals (consumption)
    - Decomposition → Atmosphere

    ### 3. Nitrogen Cycle
    - **Nitrogen Fixation**: Atmospheric N₂ → Ammonia (by bacteria)
    - **Nitrification**: Ammonia → Nitrites → Nitrates
    - **Assimilation**: Plants absorb nitrates
    - **Denitrification**: Nitrates → Atmospheric N₂

    ### 4. Oxygen Cycle
    - Photosynthesis produces O₂
    - Respiration consumes O₂

    ## Types of Ecosystems

    ### Terrestrial Ecosystems
    1. **Forest Ecosystem**: Tropical, temperate, boreal
    2. **Grassland Ecosystem**: Savannas, prairies
    3. **Desert Ecosystem**: Hot and cold deserts
    4. **Mountain Ecosystem**: High altitude regions

    ### Aquatic Ecosystems
    1. **Freshwater**: Rivers, lakes, ponds, wetlands
    2. **Marine**: Oceans, coral reefs, estuaries

    ## Ecological Succession

    ### Primary Succession
    - Starts from barren land
    - Pioneer species (lichens) → Mosses → Herbs → Shrubs → Trees

    ### Secondary Succession
    - After disturbance (fire, farming)
    - Faster than primary succession

    ## Ecological Services

    1. **Provisioning**: Food, water, timber
    2. **Regulating**: Climate regulation, flood control
    3. **Supporting**: Nutrient cycling, soil formation
    4. **Cultural**: Recreation, spiritual value

# Fundamentals of Ecology and Ecosystems

    ## What is Ecology?

    Ecology is the study of relationships between living organisms and their physical environment.

    ## Ecosystem

    ### Definition
    An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with non-living components in their environment.

    ### Components

    #### 1. Biotic Components
    - **Producers (Autotrophs)**: Plants, algae (produce food through photosynthesis)
    - **Consumers (Heterotrophs)**:
      - Primary consumers: Herbivores
      - Secondary consumers: Carnivores
      - Tertiary consumers: Top predators
    - **Decomposers**: Bacteria, fungi (break down dead matter)

    #### 2. Abiotic Components
    - Sunlight, water, air, soil, minerals, temperature

    ## Food Chain and Food Web

    ### Food Chain
    Linear sequence of organisms where nutrients and energy pass from one to another.

    Example:
    ```
    Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake → Eagle
    ```

    ### Food Web
    Interconnected food chains forming a complex network.

    ### Trophic Levels
    - **Level 1**: Producers
    - **Level 2**: Primary consumers
    - **Level 3**: Secondary consumers
    - **Level 4**: Tertiary consumers

    ### 10% Law (Lindeman's Law)
    - Only 10% energy transfers from one trophic level to next
    - 90% lost as heat, respiration, waste

    ## Ecological Pyramids

    ### 1. Pyramid of Numbers
    - Shows number of organisms at each level

    ### 2. Pyramid of Biomass
    - Shows total biomass at each level

    ### 3. Pyramid of Energy
    - Shows energy flow at each level
    - Always upright

    ## Biogeochemical Cycles

    ### 1. Water Cycle (Hydrological Cycle)
    - Evaporation → Condensation → Precipitation → Runoff

    ### 2. Carbon Cycle
    - Atmosphere ↔ Plants (photosynthesis)
    - Plants → Animals (consumption)
    - Decomposition → Atmosphere

    ### 3. Nitrogen Cycle
    - **Nitrogen Fixation**: Atmospheric N₂ → Ammonia (by bacteria)
    - **Nitrification**: Ammonia → Nitrites → Nitrates
    - **Assimilation**: Plants absorb nitrates
    - **Denitrification**: Nitrates → Atmospheric N₂

    ### 4. Oxygen Cycle
    - Photosynthesis produces O₂
    - Respiration consumes O₂

    ## Types of Ecosystems

    ### Terrestrial Ecosystems
    1. **Forest Ecosystem**: Tropical, temperate, boreal
    2. **Grassland Ecosystem**: Savannas, prairies
    3. **Desert Ecosystem**: Hot and cold deserts
    4. **Mountain Ecosystem**: High altitude regions

    ### Aquatic Ecosystems
    1. **Freshwater**: Rivers, lakes, ponds, wetlands
    2. **Marine**: Oceans, coral reefs, estuaries

    ## Ecological Succession

    ### Primary Succession
    - Starts from barren land
    - Pioneer species (lichens) → Mosses → Herbs → Shrubs → Trees

    ### Secondary Succession
    - After disturbance (fire, farming)
    - Faster than primary succession

    ## Ecological Services

    1. **Provisioning**: Food, water, timber
    2. **Regulating**: Climate regulation, flood control
    3. **Supporting**: Nutrient cycling, soil formation
    4. **Cultural**: Recreation, spiritual value
