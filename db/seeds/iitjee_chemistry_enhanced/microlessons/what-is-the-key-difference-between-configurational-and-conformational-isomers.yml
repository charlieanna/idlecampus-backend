  isomers? 🚀


  Conformational isomers (conformers) can interconvert by rotation around single bonds
  without breaking any bonds. Configurational isomers require bond breaking to interconvert.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'
