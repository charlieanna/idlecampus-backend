  # Ligands - Practice

  ## What are Ligands?

  Ligands are ions or molecules with lone pairs that donate electrons to a central metal atom/ion, forming coordinate bonds.

  ## Classification by Denticity

  | Type | Donor Atoms | Examples |
  |------|-------------|----------|
  | **Monodentate** | 1 | NH₃, H₂O, Cl⁻, CN⁻, CO |
  | **Bidentate** | 2 | en (ethylenediamine), ox (oxalate C₂O₄²⁻) |
  | **Tridentate** | 3 | dien (diethylenetriamine) |
  | **Tetradentate** | 4 | trien (triethylenetetramine) |
  | **Hexadentate** | 6 | EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) |

  ## Common Ligand Names

  ### Neutral Ligands
  - H₂O → aqua
  - NH₃ → ammine
  - CO → carbonyl
  - NO → nitrosyl
  - py (pyridine) → pyridine

  ### Anionic Ligands (add -o suffix)
  - Cl⁻ → chlorido/chloro
  - Br⁻ → bromido/bromo
  - CN⁻ → cyanido/cyano
  - OH⁻ → hydroxido/hydroxo
  - O²⁻ → oxido/oxo

  ## Ambidentate Ligands

  Ligands that can bind through different atoms:
  - **NO₂⁻**: nitro (N-bonded) or nitrito (O-bonded)
  - **SCN⁻**: thiocyanato (S-bonded) or isothiocyanato (N-bonded)

  ## Chelates and Chelate Effect

  - **Chelate**: Complex with polydentate ligands forming ring structures
  - **Chelate Effect**: Chelates are MORE stable than complexes with equivalent monodentate ligands
  - Reason: Entropy factor - releasing more molecules when chelate forms

  ## EDTA - The Most Important Hexadentate Ligand

  - **Structure**: 2 nitrogen atoms + 4 carboxylate oxygen atoms = 6 donor atoms
  - Forms very stable complexes (used in medicine, water softening)
  - Can wrap around a metal ion completely

  ## Key Points for Practice

  1. Coordination number = Number of DONOR ATOMS (not ligands!)
  2. Bidentate ligands count as 2 toward CN
  3. Chelates are more stable (chelate effect)
  4. EDTA is hexadentate with 6 donor atoms

    question: Which of the following are bidentate ligands?
    options:
      - Ethylenediamine (en) and Oxalate (C₂O₄²⁻)
      - Ammonia (NH₃) and Water (H₂O)
      - Chloride (Cl⁻) and Cyanide (CN⁻)
      - Carbon monoxide (CO) and Nitric oxide (NO)
    correct_answer_index: 0
    explanation: Bidentate ligands have 2 donor atoms. Ethylenediamine (H₂N-CH₂-CH₂-NH₂) has 2 N atoms. Oxalate (⁻O₂C-CO₂⁻) has 2 O atoms. The others are monodentate.

    question: Which statements about EDTA are correct?
    options:
      - It is hexadentate with 6 donor atoms
      - It is monodentate with 1 donor atom
      - It is bidentate with 2 donor atoms
      - It is tetradentate with 4 donor atoms
    correct_answer_index: 0
    explanation: EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is hexadentate with 2 N and 4 O donor atoms (total 6). It forms highly stable chelate complexes.

    question: What is the coordination number in [Pt(en)₂]²⁺? (en = ethylenediamine)
    options:
      - 2
      - 4
      - 6
      - 8
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: en is bidentate (2 donor atoms per ligand). 2 en ligands = 2×2 = 4 donor atoms. CN = 4, not 2!

    sequence_order: 4
    question: Why are chelate complexes more stable than complexes with monodentate ligands?
    options:
      - Entropy effect - more molecules released
      - Chelates have stronger bonds
      - Chelates are always anionic
      - Monodentate ligands are weak donors
    correct_answer_index: 0
    explanation: The chelate effect is primarily entropic. When a chelate forms, it releases more monodentate ligands, increasing entropy and making the reaction more favorable.
