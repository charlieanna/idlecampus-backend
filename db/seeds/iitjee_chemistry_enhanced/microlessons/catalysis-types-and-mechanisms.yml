  \ Introduction\n\n    **Catalyst:** A substance that alters the rate of a chemical\
  \ reaction without being consumed in the process.\n\n    **Catalysis:** The phenomenon\
  \ of altering the rate of reaction using a catalyst.\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Types\
  \ of Catalysis\n\n    ### 1. Positive Catalysis\n    - Catalyst **increases** the\
  \ rate of reaction\n    - Most common type\n    - **Example:** MnO₂ in decomposition\
  \ of KClO₃\n\n    ### 2. Negative Catalysis (Inhibition)\n    - Catalyst **decreases**\
  \ the rate of reaction\n    - **Example:** Phosphoric acid retards decomposition\
  \ of H₂O₂\n\n    ### 3. Auto-catalysis\n    - Product of reaction acts as catalyst\n\
  \    - **Example:** CH₃COOC₂H₅ + H₂O → CH₃COOH + C₂H₅OH (CH₃COOH catalyzes the reaction)\n\
  \n    ---\n\n    ## Classification Based on Phase\n\n    ### Homogeneous Catalysis\n\
  \n    **Definition:** Catalyst and reactants are in the same phase.\n\n    **Characteristics:**\n\
  \    - Usually in liquid or gas phase\n    - Catalyst uniformly distributed\n  \
  \  - High selectivity\n\n    **Examples:**\n\n    1. **Lead chamber process (SO₂\
  \ oxidation):**\n       ```\n       2SO₂(g) + O₂(g) --[NO(g)]--> 2SO₃(g)\n     \
  \  ```\n\n    2. **Esterification:**\n       ```\n       CH₃COOH(l) + C₂H₅OH(l)\
  \ --[H₂SO₄(l)]--> CH₃COOC₂H₅(l) + H₂O(l)\n       ```\n\n    3. **Hydrolysis of esters:**\n\
  \       ```\n       CH₃COOC₂H₅ + H₂O --[H⁺ or OH⁻]--> CH₃COOH + C₂H₅OH\n       ```\n\
  \n    4. **Inversion of cane sugar:**\n       ```\n       C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ + H₂O --[H⁺]-->\
  \ C₆H₁₂O₆ + C₆H₁₂O₆\n       ```\n\n    ### Heterogeneous Catalysis\n\n    **Definition:**\
  \ Catalyst and reactants are in different phases.\n\n    **Characteristics:**\n\
  \    - Catalyst is usually solid, reactants are gas or liquid\n    - Reaction occurs\
  \ on catalyst surface\n    - Surface area is important\n\n    **Examples:**\n\n\
  \    1. **Haber process (Ammonia synthesis):**\n       ```\n       N₂(g) + 3H₂(g)\
  \ --[Fe(s)]--> 2NH₃(g)\n       ```\n\n    2. **Ostwald process (Oxidation of ammonia):**\n\
  \       ```\n       4NH₃(g) + 5O₂(g) --[Pt(s)]--> 4NO(g) + 6H₂O(g)\n       ```\n\
  \n    3. **Contact process (SO₃ production):**\n       ```\n       2SO₂(g) + O₂(g)\
  \ --[V₂O₅(s)]--> 2SO₃(g)\n       ```\n\n    4. **Hydrogenation of vegetable oils:**\n\
  \       ```\n       Vegetable oil + H₂ --[Ni(s)]--> Vanaspati ghee\n       ```\n\
  \n    5. **Deacon's process (Chlorine production):**\n       ```\n       4HCl(g)\
  \ + O₂(g) --[CuCl₂(s)]--> 2Cl₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)\n       ```\n\n    | Homogeneous | Heterogeneous\
  \ |\n    |-------------|---------------|\n    | Same phase | Different phases |\n\
  \    | Uniformly distributed | Localized at interface |\n    | Example: NO in SO₂\
  \ oxidation | Example: Fe in Haber process |\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Mechanism of Heterogeneous\
  \ Catalysis\n\n    **Steps:**\n\n    1. **Diffusion:** Reactant molecules diffuse\
  \ to catalyst surface\n    2. **Adsorption:** Reactants are adsorbed on catalyst\
  \ surface (chemisorption)\n    3. **Reaction:** Adsorbed molecules react on surface\
  \ (activation energy lowered)\n    4. **Desorption:** Products desorb from surface\n\
  \    5. **Diffusion:** Products diffuse away from surface\n\n    **Active sites:**\
  \ Specific locations on catalyst surface where reaction occurs\n\n    ---\n\n  \
  \  ## Important Features of Catalysis\n\n    ### 1. Catalyst Remains Unchanged\n\
  \    - Mass and chemical composition remain same\n    - May undergo temporary physical/chemical\
  \ change\n\n    ### 2. Small Amount Required\n    - Catalyst works in very small\
  \ quantities\n    - Effect depends on surface area, not mass\n\n    ### 3. Catalyst\
  \ Cannot Initiate Reaction\n    - Can only alter rate of thermodynamically feasible\
  \ reactions\n    - Cannot make impossible reactions possible\n\n    ### 4. Catalyst\
  \ is Specific\n    - A given catalyst works for specific reactions only\n    - Example:\
  \ MnO₂ catalyzes KClO₃ decomposition but not others\n\n    ### 5. Catalyst Does\
  \ Not Alter Equilibrium\n    - Increases both forward and backward reaction rates\
  \ equally\n    - Position of equilibrium remains same\n    - Equilibrium is attained\
  \ faster\n\n    ### 6. Catalyst Lowers Activation Energy\n    - Provides alternate\
  \ pathway with lower Ea\n    - More molecules have energy ≥ Ea\n    - Rate increases\n\
  \n    ---\n\n    ## Promoters and Catalytic Poisons\n\n    ### Promoters (Co-catalysts)\n\
  \    - Substances that enhance catalyst activity\n    - **Example:** In Haber process,\
  \ Fe is catalyst, Mo acts as promoter\n\n    ### Catalytic Poisons\n    - Substances\
  \ that reduce or destroy catalyst activity\n    - **Example:**\n      - Arsenic\
  \ poisoning of Pt catalyst in Contact process\n      - CO poisoning of Fe catalyst\
  \ in Haber process\n      - Lead poisoning of catalytic converters\n\n    ---\n\n\
  \    ## Enzyme Catalysis\n\n    **Enzymes:** Biological catalysts (proteins) in\
  \ living organisms\n\n    **Characteristics:**\n    - Highly specific (lock and\
  \ key mechanism)\n    - Work under mild conditions (body temperature, neutral pH)\n\
  \    - Very efficient (increase rate by 10⁶ to 10²⁰ times)\n    - Sensitive to temperature\
  \ and pH\n\n    **Examples:**\n    - **Invertase:** Converts cane sugar to glucose\
  \ and fructose\n    - **Maltase:** Converts maltose to glucose\n    - **Urease:**\
  \ Converts urea to ammonia and CO₂\n    - **Pepsin:** Digests proteins in stomach\n\
  \    - **Amylase:** Converts starch to maltose\n\n    **Mechanism:**\n    ```\n\
  \    Enzyme (E) + Substrate (S) ⇌ E-S complex → E + Product (P)\n    ```\n\n   \
  \ ---\n\n    ## Zeolites as Catalysts\n\n    **Zeolites:** Microporous aluminosilicate\
  \ minerals with shape-selective catalysis\n\n    **Structure:**\n    - 3D network\
  \ of SiO₄ and AlO₄ tetrahedra\n    - Contains cavities and channels of molecular\
  \ dimensions\n\n    **Applications:**\n    - Petroleum refining (catalytic cracking)\n\
  \    - Petrochemical industry\n    - Conversion of alcohols to gasoline\n    - **ZSM-5:**\
  \ Used to convert methanol to gasoline\n\n    **Shape Selectivity:** Only molecules\
  \ of certain size and shape can enter pores and react\n\n    ---\n\n    ## IIT JEE\
  \ Key Points\n\n    1. Catalyst **does not alter ΔG** or equilibrium position\n\
  \    2. Catalyst **lowers activation energy** (Ea)\n    3. **Heterogeneous catalysis:**\
  \ Adsorption → Reaction → Desorption\n    4. **Homogeneous:** Same phase; **Heterogeneous:**\
  \ Different phases\n    5. **Promoters** enhance catalyst activity\n    6. **Poisons**\
  \ reduce catalyst activity\n    7. **Enzymes** are highly specific biological catalysts\n\
  \    8. **Zeolites** show shape-selective catalysis\n    9. Catalyst increases rate\
  \ of **both forward and backward** reactions equally\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Catalysis\n\
