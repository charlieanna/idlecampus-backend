  # Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT): The Complete Picture

  ## Why MOT is a JEE Favorite

  **JEE Weightage**: 3-5 marks (direct questions on bond order, magnetic properties)

  Here's why JEE loves MOT questions:
  - **VBT fails to explain why O₂ is attracted to magnets** (paramagnetic)
  - MOT gives you the REAL picture of molecular bonding
  - Bond order calculations are scoring questions if you know the formula

  **Classic JEE Question**: "Why is O₂ paramagnetic when its Lewis structure shows all electrons paired?"

  **Answer**: MOT shows O₂ has 2 unpaired electrons in antibonding orbitals!

  ## The Big Idea: Electrons Belong to the Molecule

  **MOT** says electrons don't belong to individual atoms - they spread across the ENTIRE molecule in molecular orbitals.

  ### Key Principles

  1. **Atomic orbitals combine** to form molecular orbitals (MOs)
  2. **Number of MOs = Number of AOs** that combine
  3. **Electrons fill MOs** following Aufbau principle, Hund's rule, and Pauli exclusion
  4. **Bonding MOs** are lower in energy (constructive interference)
  5. **Antibonding MOs** are higher in energy (destructive interference)

  ## Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO)

  When two atomic orbitals (ψA and ψB) combine:

  **Bonding MO**: ψb = ψA + ψB (in-phase, additive)
  - Lower energy than parent AOs
  - Electron density concentrated BETWEEN nuclei
  - Stabilizes the molecule

  **Antibonding MO**: ψ* = ψA - ψB (out-of-phase, subtractive)
  - Higher energy than parent AOs
  - Electron density concentrated AWAY from internuclear region
  - Node between nuclei
  - Destabilizes the molecule

  ## Types of Molecular Orbitals

  ### Sigma (σ) Molecular Orbitals
  - Formed from head-on overlap
  - Symmetrical around internuclear axis
  - **σ bonding** and **σ* antibonding**

  ### Pi (π) Molecular Orbitals
  - Formed from sideways overlap of p-orbitals
  - Electron density above and below internuclear axis
  - **π bonding** and **π* antibonding**

  ## MO Energy Level Diagrams

  ### For O₂, F₂, Ne₂ (and molecules with ≥15 electrons)

  **Standard Order** (σ2p is below π2p):
  ```
  σ*2p  ↑↓
  π*2p  ↑↓ ↑↓
  σ2p   ↑↓
  π2p   ↑↓ ↑↓
  σ*2s  ↑↓
  σ2s   ↑↓
  ```

  Energy order: σ1s < σ*1s < σ2s < σ*2s < σ2p < π2p < π*2p < σ*2p

  ### For N₂, C₂, B₂, Be₂, Li₂ (molecules with <15 electrons)

  **Modified Order** (π2p is below σ2p due to s-p mixing):
  ```
  σ*2p
  π*2p  ↑↓ ↑↓
  σ2p   ↑↓
  π2p   ↑↓ ↑↓
  σ*2s  ↑↓
  σ2s   ↑↓
  ```

  Energy order: σ1s < σ*1s < σ2s < σ*2s < π2p < σ2p < π*2p < σ*2p

  ## Bond Order

  **Bond Order = ½(Nb - Na)**

  Where:
  - Nb = Number of electrons in bonding MOs
  - Na = Number of electrons in antibonding MOs

  ### Significance of Bond Order
  - **Bond Order = 0**: Molecule doesn't exist (He₂, Be₂)
  - **Higher bond order**: Stronger bond, shorter bond length
  - **Fractional bond order**: Possible (O₂⁺ has BO = 2.5)

  ## MO Configuration of Important Molecules

  ### H₂ (2 electrons)
  - Configuration: σ1s²
  - Bond Order = ½(2-0) = 1
  - Diamagnetic

  ### He₂ (4 electrons)
  - Configuration: σ1s² σ*1s²
  - Bond Order = ½(2-2) = 0
  - **Does NOT exist**

  ### Li₂ (6 electrons)
  - Configuration: σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s²
  - Bond Order = ½(4-2) = 1
  - Diamagnetic

  ### Be₂ (8 electrons)
  - Configuration: σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s²
  - Bond Order = ½(4-4) = 0
  - **Does NOT exist**

  ### B₂ (10 electrons)
  - Configuration: σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² π2p¹ π2p¹
  - Bond Order = ½(6-4) = 1
  - **Paramagnetic** (2 unpaired electrons)

  ### C₂ (12 electrons)
  - Configuration: σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² π2p² π2p²
  - Bond Order = ½(8-4) = 2
  - Diamagnetic

  ### N₂ (14 electrons)
  - Configuration: σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² π2p² π2p² σ2p²
  - Bond Order = ½(10-4) = 3
  - Diamagnetic
  - **Strongest diatomic bond** (triple bond)

  ### O₂ (16 electrons)
  - Configuration: σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² σ2p² π2p² π2p² π*2p¹ π*2p¹
  - Bond Order = ½(10-6) = 2
  - **Paramagnetic** (2 unpaired electrons in π*2p)
  - This explains O₂'s paramagnetism (VBT cannot!)

  ### F₂ (18 electrons)
  - Configuration: σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² σ2p² π2p² π2p² π*2p² π*2p²
  - Bond Order = ½(10-8) = 1
  - Diamagnetic

  ### Ne₂ (20 electrons)
  - Configuration: All MOs filled
  - Bond Order = ½(10-10) = 0
  - **Does NOT exist**

  ## Molecular Ions

  ### O₂⁺ (15 electrons)
  - Remove one electron from π*2p
  - Bond Order = ½(10-5) = 2.5
  - Paramagnetic (1 unpaired electron)
  - Shorter and stronger bond than O₂

  ### O₂⁻ (17 electrons)
  - Add one electron to π*2p
  - Bond Order = ½(10-7) = 1.5
  - Paramagnetic
  - Longer and weaker bond than O₂

  ### O₂²⁻ (18 electrons)
  - Add two electrons to π*2p
  - Bond Order = ½(10-8) = 1
  - Diamagnetic
  - Peroxide ion

  ## Bond Order, Bond Length, and Bond Energy

  | Species | Bond Order | Bond Length (pm) | Bond Energy (kJ/mol) |
  |---------|------------|------------------|----------------------|
  | O₂⁺ | 2.5 | 112 | 643 |
  | O₂ | 2.0 | 121 | 498 |
  | O₂⁻ | 1.5 | 128 | 395 |
  | O₂²⁻ | 1.0 | 149 | 142 |

  **Trend**: Higher bond order → Shorter bond → Stronger bond

  ## Magnetic Properties

  - **Diamagnetic**: All electrons paired (repelled by magnetic field)
  - **Paramagnetic**: Unpaired electrons present (attracted to magnetic field)

  MOT successfully explains O₂'s paramagnetism, which VBT cannot explain!

  ## MOT vs VBT

  | Aspect | VBT | MOT |
  |--------|-----|-----|
  | Orbital view | Localized bonds | Delocalized MOs |
  | Paramagnetism of O₂ | Cannot explain | Explains correctly |
  | Bond order | Always whole numbers | Can be fractional |
  | Resonance | Needs special treatment | Naturally handled |

    question: B₂ molecule is paramagnetic because:
    options:
      - It has zero bond order
      - It has 2 unpaired electrons in π2p orbitals
      - It has antibonding electrons only
      - Boron is a metal

    question: The bond order of O₂⁺ is:
    options:
      - 1.5
      - 2.0
      - 2.5
      - 3.0
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: O₂⁺ has 15 electrons (16-1). One electron is removed from the antibonding π*2p. Bond Order = ½(10-5) = 2.5. This is why O₂⁺ has a shorter, stronger bond than O₂.

    slug: mot-bond-length-order
    sequence_order: 7
    question: Arrange in order of INCREASING bond length - O₂, O₂⁺, O₂⁻, O₂²⁻
    options:
      - O₂⁺ < O₂ < O₂⁻ < O₂²⁻
      - O₂²⁻ < O₂⁻ < O₂ < O₂⁺
      - O₂ < O₂⁺ < O₂⁻ < O₂²⁻
      - O₂⁻ < O₂ < O₂⁺ < O₂²⁻
    correct_answer_index: 0
    explanation: Bond length is inversely related to bond order. O₂⁺ (BO=2.5) < O₂ (BO=2) < O₂⁻ (BO=1.5) < O₂²⁻ (BO=1). Higher bond order = shorter bond.

    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: C₂ has 12 electrons. For molecules with <15 electrons, π2p is below σ2p. So configuration is σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² π2p⁴ (or π2p² π2p²). Bond order = 2.

    question: Antibonding molecular orbitals:
    options:
      - Have lower energy than bonding orbitals
      - Have electron density concentrated between nuclei
      - Have a nodal plane between nuclei
      - Stabilize the molecule
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: Antibonding MOs form by destructive interference, creating a nodal plane (zero electron density) between nuclei. They are higher in energy and destabilize the molecule.

      - F₂⁻ does not exist
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: F₂⁻ has 19 electrons (18+1). Extra electron goes to σ*2p. Bond order = ½(10-9) = 0.5. Lower than F₂ (BO=1), so longer and weaker bond.

  - type: mcq
    slug: mot-why-modified-order
    sequence_order: 15
    question: Why is the MO energy order different for N₂ compared to O₂?
    options:
      - N₂ has fewer protons
      - s-p mixing is significant in N₂, raising σ2p above π2p
      - O₂ is paramagnetic
      - N₂ has a triple bond
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: In molecules with <15 electrons (like N₂), s-p orbital mixing is significant because the energy gap between 2s and 2p is small. This pushes σ2p above π2p in energy.
