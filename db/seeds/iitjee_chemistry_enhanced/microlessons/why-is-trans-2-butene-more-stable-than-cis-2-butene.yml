  trans-2-butene is more stable because the two CH₃ groups are on opposite sides of
  the double bond (180° apart), minimizing steric repulsion. In cis, they are on the
  same side causing repulsion.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'
