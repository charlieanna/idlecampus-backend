  # VSEPR Theory and Molecular Geometry

  **VSEPR** = Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion

  ## Core Principle

  Electron pairs (both bonding and lone pairs) around a central atom repel each other and arrange themselves to **minimize repulsion** by maximizing the distance between them.

  ## Key Terms

  - **Steric Number (SN)** = Number of atoms bonded + Number of lone pairs
  - **Electron Pair Geometry**: Arrangement of ALL electron pairs
  - **Molecular Geometry**: Arrangement of ATOMS only (ignores lone pairs)

  ## Order of Repulsion

  **Lone pair-Lone pair > Lone pair-Bond pair > Bond pair-Bond pair**

  This is why lone pairs compress bond angles!

  ## VSEPR Geometries Table

  |----|------------|-------------------|------------|----------|
  | 2 | 0 | Linear | 180° | BeCl₂, CO₂, HCN |

  | 5 | 1 | See-saw | <90°, <120° | SF₄, TeCl₄ |
  | 5 | 2 | T-shaped | <90° | ClF₃, BrF₃ |

  ## Detailed Analysis by Steric Number

  ### SN = 2: Linear Geometry
  - **Electron pair geometry**: Linear
  - **Examples**: BeCl₂, CO₂, HCN, C₂H₂
  - **Bond angle**: 180°
  - **Hybridization**: sp

  ### SN = 3: Trigonal Planar Family

  **No lone pairs → Trigonal Planar (120°)**
  - BF₃, BCl₃, AlCl₃, SO₃, NO₃⁻, CO₃²⁻
  - Hybridization: sp²

  **1 lone pair → Bent (~117°)**
  - SO₂, O₃, NO₂⁻, SnCl₂
  - Lone pair compresses bond angle below 120°

  ### SN = 4: Tetrahedral Family

  **No lone pairs → Tetrahedral (109.5°)**
  - CH₄, CCl₄, SiH₄, NH₄⁺, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, ClO₄⁻
  - Hybridization: sp³

  **1 lone pair → Trigonal Pyramidal (~107°)**
  - NH₃, NF₃, PH₃, PCl₃, AsH₃
  - Lone pair reduces bond angle

  **2 lone pairs → Bent/V-shaped (~104.5°)**
  - H₂O, H₂S, OF₂, SCl₂
  - Two lone pairs compress angle further

  ### SN = 5: Trigonal Bipyramidal Family

  **Positions**: Axial (top/bottom, 90° from equatorial) and Equatorial (middle plane, 120° apart)

  **Lone pairs prefer EQUATORIAL positions** (more space, less repulsion)

  **No lone pairs → Trigonal Bipyramidal**
  - PCl₅, PF₅, SbCl₅
  - Hybridization: sp³d

  **1 lone pair → See-saw (distorted)**
  - SF₄, TeCl₄, IF₄⁺
  - Lone pair in equatorial position

  **2 lone pairs → T-shaped**
  - ClF₃, BrF₃, ICl₃
  - Both lone pairs equatorial

  **3 lone pairs → Linear**
  - XeF₂, I₃⁻, ICl₂⁻
  - Three lone pairs equatorial, atoms axial

  ### SN = 6: Octahedral Family

  **No lone pairs → Octahedral (90°)**
  - SF₆, SeF₆, [PtCl₆]²⁻, [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻
  - Hybridization: sp³d²

  **1 lone pair → Square Pyramidal**
  - BrF₅, IF₅, XeOF₄
  - Lone pair in one axial position

  **2 lone pairs → Square Planar**
  - XeF₄, [ICl₄]⁻, [PtCl₄]²⁻ (also d⁸ complexes)
  - Lone pairs in opposite axial positions

  ## Effect of Electronegativity on Bond Angle

  More electronegative atoms pull bonding electrons closer to themselves, reducing bond pair-bond pair repulsion:

  - **NF₃ (102°) < NH₃ (107°)**: F is more electronegative than H
  - **OF₂ (103°) < H₂O (104.5°)**: F pulls electrons away from O

  ## Special Cases

  ### Why is H₂O bent but CO₂ linear?
  - CO₂: C has no lone pairs, SN = 2 → Linear
  - H₂O: O has 2 lone pairs, SN = 4 → Bent

  ### XeF₂ vs XeF₄
  - XeF₂: SN = 5 (2 bonds + 3 LP) → Linear
  - XeF₄: SN = 6 (4 bonds + 2 LP) → Square planar

  ## Steps to Predict Geometry

  1. Draw Lewis structure
  2. Count bonding pairs and lone pairs on central atom
  3. Calculate Steric Number = bonds + lone pairs
  4. Determine electron pair geometry
  5. Determine molecular geometry (exclude lone pairs)
  6. Predict approximate bond angles

  ## Key Points for IIT JEE

  1. **Lone pairs occupy more space than bond pairs**
  2. **Lone pairs prefer equatorial positions in TBP**
  3. **Bond angle decreases with more lone pairs**
  4. **XeF₂ is linear (not bent) due to 3 equatorial lone pairs**
  5. **Square planar can arise from SN=6 with 2 LP (not SN=4)**

    slug: vsepr-nf3-vs-nh3
    sequence_order: 13
    question: The bond angle in NF₃ (102°) is less than in NH₃ (107°) because:
    options:
      - F atoms are larger than H atoms
      - F is more electronegative, pulling bonding electrons closer to itself
      - NF₃ has more lone pairs than NH₃
      - N-F bonds are longer than N-H bonds
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Fluorine's high electronegativity pulls the bonding electrons closer to F and away from N. This reduces bond pair-bond pair repulsion, allowing the lone pair to compress the bond angle more.
