  # Fajans' Rules - Practice

  ## Key Concept

  **Fajans' Rules** predict when an ionic bond will have significant covalent character.

  ### Polarization
  - **Polarizing power**: Ability of cation to distort the electron cloud of anion
  - **Polarizability**: Ability of anion to be distorted

  ### Factors Increasing Covalent Character

  | Factor | Effect | Reason |
  |--------|--------|--------|
  | Small cation | ↑ Covalent | Higher charge density |
  | Large anion | ↑ Covalent | Easily distorted electron cloud |
  | High cation charge | ↑ Covalent | Greater polarizing power |
  | High anion charge | ↑ Covalent | More electrons to distort |
  | Cation with d or f electrons | ↑ Covalent | Poor shielding, high Zeff |

  ### Polarizing Power Order
  - Li⁺ > Na⁺ > K⁺ > Rb⁺ > Cs⁺ (smaller = higher)
  - Al³⁺ > Mg²⁺ > Na⁺ (higher charge = higher)
  - Cu⁺ > Na⁺ (same size, but d electrons in Cu⁺)

    question: According to Fajans' rules, covalent character increases with:
    options:
      - Large cation and small anion
      - Small cation and large anion
      - Large cation and large anion
      - Equal sized cation and anion
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Small cations have high charge density (polarizing power) and large anions have diffuse electron clouds (easily polarized). Both increase covalent character.

    question: Which compound has more covalent character?
    options:
      - NaCl
      - LiCl
      - KCl
      - RbCl
    correct_answer_index: 1

    sequence_order: 5
    question: Why are silver halides (AgCl, AgBr, AgI) colored and insoluble?
    options:
      - Ag⁺ is a large cation
      - Ag⁺ has d¹⁰ configuration with high polarizing power
      - Silver is a transition metal
      - Halides are unstable
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Ag⁺ has d¹⁰ configuration with poor shielding, giving it high polarizing power despite moderate size. This causes significant covalent character, making silver halides colored and insoluble.

    sequence_order: 6
    question: LiCl is more soluble in organic solvents than NaCl because:
    options:
      - LiCl has higher lattice energy
      - LiCl has more covalent character
      - Li⁺ is smaller and more ionic
      - NaCl has lower melting point
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Higher covalent character makes compounds more soluble in non-polar/organic solvents. Li⁺'s high polarizing power gives LiCl significant covalent character.

    question: Cu⁺ and Na⁺ have similar ionic radii. Which forms more covalent compounds?
    options:
      - Na⁺
      - Cu⁺
      - Both equal
      - Cannot be determined
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Cu⁺ has d¹⁰ configuration. d-electrons provide poor shielding, increasing effective nuclear charge and polarizing power. Cu⁺ compounds are more covalent than Na⁺ compounds.

    question: Why do beryllium compounds show anomalous properties (more covalent than expected)?
    options:
      - Be has noble gas configuration
      - Be²⁺ is extremely small with high charge density
      - Be is not in s-block
      - Be forms only coordinate bonds
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Be²⁺ has the smallest ionic radius and +2 charge, giving exceptionally high polarizing power. BeCl₂ is covalent, not ionic.

      - NaCl
      - KBr
      - AgI
      - CaF₂

    question: PbI₂ is yellow while PbCl₂ is white because:
    options:
      - Pb²⁺ has different oxidation states
      - I⁻ is more polarizable than Cl⁻
      - PbCl₂ has higher lattice energy
      - Lead is a transition metal
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: I⁻ is larger and more polarizable than Cl⁻. Greater polarization in PbI₂ causes more covalent character, smaller band gap, and absorption of blue light (appears yellow).

    slug: fajans-caco3-stability
    sequence_order: 14
    question: Among Group 2 carbonates, BeCO₃ decomposes most easily because:
    options:
      - Be is not a true alkaline earth metal
      - Be²⁺ highly polarizes CO₃²⁻, destabilizing it
      - BeCO₃ has lowest lattice energy
      - Beryllium is radioactive
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Be²⁺ is tiny with +2 charge (highest polarizing power in Group 2). It strongly polarizes CO₃²⁻, weakening C-O bonds and facilitating decomposition to BeO + CO₂.

    slug: fajans-alcl3-dimer
