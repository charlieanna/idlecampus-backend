  Chirality means non-superimposability on mirror image. While chiral molecules usually
  have chiral centers and are optically active, the fundamental definition is about
  mirror image non-superimposability.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'
