  in alkenes? 🚀


  Geometrical isomerism requires: (1) Restricted rotation (C=C or ring) and (2) Different
  groups on each carbon. It does NOT require chirality or specific H atoms.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'
