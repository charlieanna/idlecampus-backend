  Catalysts lower activation energy and speed up both forward/backward reactions equally,
  so equilibrium position is unchanged. They do not alter ΔG or make impossible reactions
  possible.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'
