  # Werner's Theory - Practice

  ## Key Concepts

  ### Werner's Postulates
  1. **Primary Valence**: Oxidation state of metal, satisfied by anionic groups (ionizable)
  2. **Secondary Valence**: Coordination number, satisfied by ligands in coordination sphere (non-ionizable)
  3. Ligands can satisfy both primary and secondary valence

  ### Notation
  - **[ ]** = Coordination sphere (non-ionizable)
  - Groups outside brackets = Counter ions (ionizable)

  ### Example: [Co(NH₃)₆]Cl₃
  - **Primary valence** = 3 (Co³⁺, satisfied by 3 Cl⁻ outside)
  - **Secondary valence** = 6 (6 NH₃ in coordination sphere)

    question: In [Co(NH₃)₆]Cl₃, the primary valence of cobalt is:
    options:
      - 2
      - 3
      - 6
      - 9
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Primary valence = oxidation state. Complex has +3 charge (balances 3 Cl⁻), so Co is +3 and primary valence = 3.

      - 3
      - 6
      - 9
      - 12
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Secondary valence = coordination number = number of donor atoms directly bonded to metal. 6 NH₃ ligands give CN = 6.

    question: In [Pt(NH₃)₄Cl₂]Cl₂, how many Cl⁻ ions are ionizable?
    options:
      - 0
      - 2
      - 4
      - 6
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Only Cl⁻ outside the coordination sphere (brackets) are ionizable. 2 Cl are inside (non-ionizable), 2 Cl are outside (ionizable).

    question: "On adding AgNO₃ to [Co(NH₃)₅Cl]Cl₂ solution, how many moles of AgCl precipitate per mole of complex?"
    options:
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
      - 0
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Only ionizable Cl⁻ (outside brackets) precipitate with AgNO₃. 2 Cl are outside, 1 Cl is inside the coordination sphere. So 2 moles AgCl form.

      - CN⁻ only
      - Both Fe and CN⁻
      - Neither
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: The coordination sphere includes the central metal AND all ligands directly bonded to it. Both Fe and 6 CN⁻ are in the coordination sphere.

    question: In [CoCl(NH₃)₅]Cl₂, one Cl⁻ satisfies:
    options:
      - Only primary valence
      - Only secondary valence
      - Both primary and secondary valence
      - Neither valence
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: The Cl⁻ inside the coordination sphere donates to Co (secondary valence) and also provides -1 charge helping balance Co's +3 (primary valence). It satisfies both.

    question: "Among CoCl₃·6NH₃, CoCl₃·5NH₃, CoCl₃·4NH₃, which has the highest molar conductivity?"
    options:
      - CoCl₃·6NH₃
      - CoCl₃·5NH₃
      - CoCl₃·4NH₃
      - All have same conductivity
    correct_answer_index: 0
    explanation: CoCl₃·6NH₃ = [Co(NH₃)₆]Cl₃ has 4 ions (1 cation + 3 anions). More ions = higher conductivity. Others have fewer ionizable ions.

    question: According to Sidgwick's EAN rule, a stable complex has EAN equal to:
    options:
      - Atomic number of the metal
      - 18
      - Nearest noble gas atomic number
