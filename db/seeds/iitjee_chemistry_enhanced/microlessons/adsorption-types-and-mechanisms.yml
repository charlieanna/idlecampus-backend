  \  ## Introduction\n\n    **Adsorption** is the phenomenon of accumulation of molecules\
  \ of a substance on the surface of a solid or liquid, forming a molecular or atomic\
  \ film.\n\n    - **Adsorbate:** The substance that gets adsorbed\n    - **Adsorbent:**\
  \ The surface on which adsorption occurs\n\n    **Examples:**\n    - Activated charcoal\
  \ adsorbs gases\n    - Silica gel adsorbs moisture\n    - Animal charcoal decolorizes\
  \ sugar solutions\n\n    ## Adsorption vs Absorption\n\n    | Adsorption | Absorption\
  \ |\n    |------------|------------|\n    | Surface phenomenon | Bulk phenomenon\
  \ |\n    | Concentration on surface | Uniform distribution throughout |\n    | Example:\
  \ Gas on charcoal | Example: Water in sponge |\n\n    **Sorption:** When both adsorption\
  \ and absorption occur simultaneously\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Types of Adsorption\n\
  \n    ### 1. Physical Adsorption (Physisorption)\n\n    **Characteristics:**\n \
  \   - **Forces:** Weak van der Waals forces\n    - **Heat of adsorption:** Low (20-40\
  \ kJ/mol)\n    - **Temperature:** Occurs at low temperatures\n    - **Reversibility:**\
  \ Easily reversible\n    - **Specificity:** Non-specific (any gas can be adsorbed)\n\
  \    - **Layer formation:** Can form multi-molecular layers\n    - **Activation\
  \ energy:** Not required\n\n    **Example:** Adsorption of N₂ on iron at low temperature\n\
  \n    ### 2. Chemical Adsorption (Chemisorption)\n\n    **Characteristics:**\n \
  \   - **Forces:** Strong chemical bonds (covalent/ionic)\n    - **Heat of adsorption:**\
  \ High (80-400 kJ/mol)\n    - **Temperature:** Occurs at high temperatures\n   \
  \ - **Reversibility:** Irreversible\n    - **Specificity:** Highly specific\n  \
  \  - **Layer formation:** Forms unimolecular layer only\n    - **Activation energy:**\
  \ Required\n\n    **Example:** Adsorption of H₂ on nickel\n\n    | Property | Physisorption\
  \ | Chemisorption |\n    |----------|---------------|---------------|\n    | Nature\
  \ of forces | Van der Waals | Chemical bonds |\n    | Heat of adsorption | 20-40\
  \ kJ/mol | 80-400 kJ/mol |\n    | Temperature | Low temperature favored | High temperature\
  \ favored |\n    | Reversibility | Reversible | Irreversible |\n    | Specificity\
  \ | Non-specific | Highly specific |\n    | Layers | Multi-layer | Mono-layer |\n\
  \    | Activation energy | Not required | Required |\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Factors\
  \ Affecting Adsorption\n\n    ### 1. Nature of Adsorbent\n    - **Surface area:**\
  \ Greater surface area → More adsorption\n    - **Porosity:** Porous materials have\
  \ higher adsorption capacity\n    - **Activation:** Activated charcoal has very\
  \ high surface area\n\n    ### 2. Nature of Adsorbate\n    - **Easily liquefiable\
  \ gases** (high critical temperature) are easily adsorbed\n    - Order: NH₃ > SO₂\
  \ > HCl > CO₂ > CH₄ > H₂ > N₂\n    - Polar molecules are preferentially adsorbed\
  \ over non-polar\n\n    ### 3. Temperature\n    - **Physisorption:** Decreases with\
  \ increasing temperature (exothermic)\n    - **Chemisorption:** Initially increases,\
  \ then decreases\n\n    ### 4. Pressure\n    - **Increases with pressure** at constant\
  \ temperature\n    - At high pressure, adsorption becomes independent of pressure\
  \ (saturation)\n\n    ---\n\n    ## Adsorption Isotherms\n\n    Adsorption isotherms\
  \ are graphs showing the variation of adsorption with pressure at constant temperature.\n\
  \n    ### 1. Freundlich Adsorption Isotherm\n\n    **Equation:**\n    ```\n    x/m\
  \ = k·P^(1/n)\n    ```\n\n    Where:\n    - x = mass of gas adsorbed\n    - m =\
  \ mass of adsorbent\n    - P = pressure\n    - k, n = constants (depend on nature\
  \ of adsorbate and adsorbent)\n    - n > 1\n\n    **Logarithmic form:**\n    ```\n\
  \    log(x/m) = log k + (1/n)log P\n    ```\n\n    This is a straight line with:\n\
  \    - Slope = 1/n\n    - Intercept = log k\n\n    **Validity:**\n    - Valid for\
  \ moderate pressure range\n    - Fails at very low and very high pressures\n\n \
  \   ### 2. Langmuir Adsorption Isotherm\n\n    **Assumptions:**\n    - Adsorption\
  \ occurs on specific sites on the adsorbent surface\n    - Each site can hold only\
  \ one molecule (monolayer)\n    - All sites are equivalent\n    - No interaction\
  \ between adsorbed molecules\n\n    **Equation:**\n    ```\n    x/m = (a·b·P)/(1\
  \ + b·P)\n    ```\n\n    Where:\n    - a = maximum adsorption capacity\n    - b\
  \ = constant related to enthalpy of adsorption\n\n    **At low pressure:** x/m =\
  \ a·b·P (linear)\n    **At high pressure:** x/m = a (constant, saturation)\n\n \
  \   ---\n\n    ## Applications of Adsorption\n\n    1. **Gas masks:** Activated\
  \ charcoal adsorbs poisonous gases\n    2. **Decolorization:** Animal charcoal removes\
  \ colored impurities from sugar\n    3. **Water purification:** Removal of odor\
  \ and taste\n    4. **Humidity control:** Silica gel and alumina gel\n    5. **Chromatography:**\
  \ Separation of mixtures\n    6. **Heterogeneous catalysis:** Catalyst provides\
  \ surface for reaction\n    7. **Froth flotation:** Separation of ores\n\n    ---\n\
  \n    ## IIT JEE Key Points\n\n    1. Adsorption is **exothermic** (ΔH < 0)\n  \
  \  2. **Entropy decreases** during adsorption (ΔS < 0)\n    3. For spontaneity:\
  \ ΔG = ΔH - TΔS < 0\n    4. Physisorption occurs at **low temperature**\n    5.\
  \ Chemisorption requires **activation energy**\n    6. **Freundlich isotherm:**\
  \ x/m = k·P^(1/n), valid at moderate pressure\n    7. **Langmuir isotherm:** Based\
  \ on monolayer adsorption\n    8. Easily liquefiable gases are **readily adsorbed**\n\
