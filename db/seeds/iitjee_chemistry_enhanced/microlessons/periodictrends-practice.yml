  # Periodic Trends - Practice

  ## Summary of Trends

  | Property | Across Period (→) | Down Group (↓) |
  |----------|-------------------|----------------|
  | Atomic radius | Decreases | Increases |
  | Ionization energy | Increases | Decreases |
  | Electron affinity | More negative | Less negative |
  | Electronegativity | Increases | Decreases |
  | Metallic character | Decreases | Increases |

  ## Key Exceptions to Remember
  - **IE**: Be > B, N > O, Mg > Al
  - **EA**: Cl > F (small size of F causes repulsion)
  - **Isoelectronic**: More protons = smaller radius

exercises:
  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-metallic-order
    sequence_order: 1
    question: Arrange in order of INCREASING metallic character - Li, Na, K, Rb
    options:
      - Li < Na < K < Rb
      - Rb < K < Na < Li
      - Na < Li < K < Rb
      - K < Rb < Na < Li
    correct_answer_index: 0
    explanation: Metallic character increases down a group as atoms become larger and lose electrons more easily. Order - Li < Na < K < Rb.
    difficulty: easy

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-atomic-radius-period
    sequence_order: 2
    question: Arrange in order of INCREASING atomic radius - Na, Mg, Al, Si
    options:
      - Na < Mg < Al < Si
      - Si < Al < Mg < Na
      - Al < Si < Mg < Na
      - Mg < Al < Si < Na
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Atomic radius DECREASES across a period due to increasing nuclear charge. Si (smallest) < Al < Mg < Na (largest).
    difficulty: easy

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-ie-exception-be-b
    sequence_order: 3
    question: Why is the first ionization energy of Be greater than B?
    options:
      - Be has more protons
      - B loses an electron from 2p (higher energy) vs Be's 2s
      - Be has larger atomic radius
      - B has higher electronegativity
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: B's outermost electron is in the 2p orbital (higher energy, easier to remove) while Be's is in the more stable 2s orbital.
    difficulty: medium

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-ie-exception-n-o
    sequence_order: 4
    question: The first ionization energy of N is higher than O because:
    options:
      - N has more protons
      - N has smaller atomic radius
      - O has paired electrons in 2p causing repulsion
      - N has higher electronegativity
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: O (2s²2p⁴) has one paired 2p electron. The repulsion makes it easier to remove, lowering IE. N (2s²2p³) has all unpaired 2p electrons.
    difficulty: medium

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-ea-cl-vs-f
    sequence_order: 5
    question: Why does Cl have more negative electron affinity than F?
    options:
      - Cl is more electronegative
      - F is too small causing electron-electron repulsion
      - Cl has more protons
      - F has noble gas configuration
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: F is very small, so adding an electron to the compact 2p orbital causes significant repulsion. Cl's larger 3p orbital has more space.
    difficulty: medium

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-isoelectronic-radius
    sequence_order: 6
    question: Arrange isoelectronic species in order of INCREASING ionic radius - O²⁻, F⁻, Na⁺, Mg²⁺
    options:
      - Mg²⁺ < Na⁺ < F⁻ < O²⁻
      - O²⁻ < F⁻ < Na⁺ < Mg²⁺
      - Na⁺ < F⁻ < O²⁻ < Mg²⁺
      - F⁻ < O²⁻ < Mg²⁺ < Na⁺
    correct_answer_index: 0
    explanation: All have 10 electrons. More protons = smaller radius. Mg²⁺(12p) < Na⁺(11p) < F⁻(9p) < O²⁻(8p).
    difficulty: hard

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-electronegativity-highest
    sequence_order: 7
    question: Which element has the highest electronegativity?
    options:
      - Oxygen
      - Nitrogen
      - Fluorine
      - Chlorine
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: Fluorine has the highest electronegativity (4.0 on Pauling scale) of all elements due to smallest size and highest effective nuclear charge in Period 2.
    difficulty: easy

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-diagonal-relationship
    sequence_order: 8
    question: Li shows diagonal relationship with:
    options:
      - Na
      - Be
      - Mg
      - Al
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: Li and Mg have similar charge/radius ratios (polarizing power). Both form nitrides with N₂, both form covalent organometallic compounds.
    difficulty: medium

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-cation-anion-size
    sequence_order: 9
    question: Which statement about ionic radii is CORRECT?
    options:
      - Cations are larger than parent atoms
      - Anions are smaller than parent atoms
      - Na⁺ is larger than Na
      - Cl⁻ is larger than Cl
    correct_answer_index: 3
    explanation: Anions gain electrons, increasing electron-electron repulsion and expanding the electron cloud. Cations lose electrons and shrink.
    difficulty: easy

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-second-ie-jump
    sequence_order: 10
    question: For which element is the jump from IE₂ to IE₃ largest?
    options:
      - Na
      - Mg
      - Al
      - Si
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Mg is [Ne]3s². After losing 2 electrons (Mg²⁺ = [Ne]), removing a 3rd electron breaks into the noble gas core, requiring huge energy.
    difficulty: hard

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-atomic-radius-group
    sequence_order: 11
    question: Atomic radius increases down a group because:
    options:
      - Nuclear charge decreases
      - More electron shells are added
      - Electronegativity increases
      - Ionization energy increases
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Going down a group adds new principal energy levels (shells). Although nuclear charge increases, the shielding effect and larger shells cause radius to increase.
    difficulty: easy

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-zeff-across-period
    sequence_order: 12
    question: Effective nuclear charge (Zeff) across a period:
    options:
      - Decreases due to shielding
      - Increases due to poor shielding by same-shell electrons
      - Remains constant
      - First increases then decreases
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Across a period, electrons are added to the same shell while protons increase. Same-shell electrons shield poorly, so Zeff increases.
    difficulty: medium

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-group2-ea
    sequence_order: 13
    question: Group 2 elements have nearly zero electron affinity because:
    options:
      - They have large atomic radii
      - Their ns² configuration is stable
      - They are metals
      - They have high ionization energy
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Group 2 elements have stable ns² configuration. Adding an electron would go to a higher energy np orbital, which is unfavorable.
    difficulty: medium

  - type: numerical
    slug: pt-valence-electrons
    sequence_order: 14
    question: How many valence electrons does sulfur (S) have?
    correct_answer: "6"
    explanation: Sulfur is in Group 16 (VIA). Elements in Group 16 have 6 valence electrons (ns²np⁴ configuration).
    difficulty: easy

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-lanthanoid-contraction
    sequence_order: 15
    question: Due to lanthanoid contraction, which pair has similar atomic radii?
    options:
      - Ti and Zr
      - Zr and Hf
      - Fe and Ru
      - Sc and Y
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Lanthanoid contraction causes Hf (Period 6) to have nearly the same radius as Zr (Period 5). The 4f electrons provide poor shielding.
    difficulty: hard

  - type: mcq
    slug: pt-ie-trend-period
    sequence_order: 16

      - Li
      - C
      - N
      - Ne
    correct_answer_index: 3
    explanation: Ne has the highest IE in Period 2 - smallest radius and completely filled, stable electron configuration. IE generally increases across a period.
