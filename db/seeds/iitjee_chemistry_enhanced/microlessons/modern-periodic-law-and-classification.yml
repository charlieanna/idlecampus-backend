  # The Periodic Table: Your Ultimate Cheat Sheet for IIT JEE

  ## Why This Topic is CRITICAL for JEE

  **JEE Weightage**: 2-4 marks directly + Foundation for 30+ marks of Inorganic Chemistry

  Here's the truth: The Periodic Table is not just another topic to memorize. It's the **GPS of Chemistry**. Once you master it, you can PREDICT:
  - Which elements react with what
  - Why some elements are metals and others are not
  - The formulas of compounds without memorizing them
  - Properties of elements you've never even heard of

  **JEE Pattern**: Questions often ask you to identify elements from their position, predict properties, or find anomalies. This lesson teaches you the LOGIC behind these predictions.

  ## The Big Picture: What is the Periodic Table?

  Think of it as a **seating arrangement** where 118 elements are placed based on ONE simple rule:

  **Modern Periodic Law (Moseley, 1913)**:
  > "Properties of elements are periodic functions of their ATOMIC NUMBER."

  **Why atomic number and not atomic mass?**
  - Mendeleev used atomic mass (1869) but had to swap some elements (like Te and I) to make properties match
  - Moseley discovered that nuclear charge (protons = atomic number) is what actually determines chemical behavior
  - This fixed all of Mendeleev's anomalies

  **JEE Trap**: Questions may ask why Ar (mass 40) comes before K (mass 39). Answer: We arrange by atomic number (Ar=18, K=19), not mass!

  ## The Structure: Rows and Columns

  ### PERIODS (Horizontal Rows) - 7 in total

  **The Golden Rule**: Period number = Number of electron shells

  | Period | Shells | Example | Configuration |
  |--------|--------|---------|---------------|
  | 1 | 1 (K) | H, He | 1s |
  | 2 | 2 (K, L) | Li to Ne | 1s 2s 2p |
  | 3 | 3 (K, L, M) | Na to Ar | ...3s 3p |
  | 4 | 4 (K, L, M, N) | K to Kr | ...4s 3d 4p |
  | 5 | 5 | Rb to Xe | ...5s 4d 5p |
  | 6 | 6 | Cs to Rn | ...6s 4f 5d 6p |
  | 7 | 7 | Fr onwards | ...7s 5f 6d 7p |

  **JEE Shortcut**: Given electron configuration, identify period from the highest shell number.
  Example: [Ar] 3d10 4s2 4p3 → Period 4 (highest shell = 4)

  ### GROUPS (Vertical Columns) - 18 in total

  **The Golden Rule**: Group number tells you valence electrons (for main group)

  | Group | Valence e⁻ | Name | Example |
  |-------|------------|------|---------|
  | 1 | 1 | Alkali metals | Li, Na, K |
  | 2 | 2 | Alkaline earth | Be, Mg, Ca |
  | 13 | 3 | Boron family | B, Al, Ga |
  | 14 | 4 | Carbon family | C, Si, Ge |
  | 15 | 5 | Pnictogens | N, P, As |
  | 16 | 6 | Chalcogens | O, S, Se |
  | 17 | 7 | Halogens | F, Cl, Br |
  | 18 | 8 | Noble gases | He, Ne, Ar |

  **JEE Formula**: For groups 1-2: Group = Valence electrons
  For groups 13-18: Valence electrons = Group - 10

  ## The Four Blocks: s, p, d, f

  This is where the periodic table becomes POWERFUL. Elements are grouped by which orbital is being filled.

  ### s-Block (Groups 1-2)
  - **Configuration**: ns¹ or ns²
  - **Character**: Highly reactive metals (lose electrons easily)
  - **JEE Focus**: Flame colors, reactions with water, diagonal relationships

  ### p-Block (Groups 13-18)
  - **Configuration**: ns² np¹⁻⁶
  - **Character**: Most diverse - metals, nonmetals, metalloids
  - **JEE Focus**: Highest weightage in Inorganic! Anomalous behavior of first element, oxidation states

  ### d-Block (Groups 3-12) - Transition Elements
  - **Configuration**: (n-1)d¹⁻¹⁰ ns¹⁻²
  - **Character**: All metals, variable oxidation states, colored compounds
  - **JEE Focus**: Color of ions, magnetic properties, complex formation

  ### f-Block - Inner Transition Elements
  - **Lanthanoids**: Ce to Lu (4f filling)
  - **Actinoids**: Th to Lr (5f filling)
  - **JEE Focus**: Lanthanoid contraction, +3 most stable oxidation state

  ## Quick Identification Tricks for JEE

  **Given atomic number, find block:**
  1. Write electron configuration
  2. See which subshell is being filled LAST
  3. That's your block!

  **Example**: Z = 26 (Fe)
  - Config: [Ar] 3d⁶ 4s²
  - Last filled: 3d (even though 4s is written last, 3d is being filled)
  - Block: d-block

  **Example**: Z = 35 (Br)
  - Config: [Ar] 3d¹⁰ 4s² 4p⁵
  - Last filled: 4p
  - Block: p-block

  ## What You'll Learn Next

  Now that you understand the MAP, we'll explore:
  1. **Periodic Trends** - How properties change across periods and down groups
  2. **Chemical Bonding** - Why and how atoms combine
  3. **p-Block Elements** - The most JEE-heavy section

  Each builds on this foundation. Master this, and you'll see patterns everywhere!

  ## Key Takeaways for JEE

  1. **Modern periodic law uses ATOMIC NUMBER** (not mass)
  2. **Period = Number of shells** in an atom
  3. **Group = Valence electrons** (with the Group-10 formula for p-block)
  4. **Block = Which orbital is being filled last**
  5. Elements in the same group have similar properties (same valence electrons)

    question: Argon (mass 40) is placed BEFORE Potassium (mass 39) because periodic table is arranged by
    options:
      - Atomic mass in increasing order
      - Atomic number in increasing order

    question: What is the atomic number of the element in Group 15, Period 3?
    correct_answer: "15"
    explanation: This element is Phosphorus (P). Period 3 starts at Na (Z=11). Group 15 in Period 3 means we add 4 more elements (Si=14, then P=15).

  - type: mcq
    slug: block-from-config
    sequence_order: 9
    question: An element has configuration [Xe] 4f¹⁴ 5d¹⁰ 6s² 6p². Which block does it belong to?

      - s-block
      - p-block
      - d-block
      - f-block
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: The LAST orbital being filled determines the block. Here 6p is being filled last (6p²), so it's p-block. This is Lead (Pb). The 4f and 5d are already full.

      - Group 1
      - Group 14
      - Group 17
      - Group 18
    correct_answer_index: 3
    explanation: Group 18 (noble gases) have complete valence shells - ns²np⁶ (except He which is 1s²). This makes them chemically inert.

      - d-block elements only
    correct_answer_index: 2
