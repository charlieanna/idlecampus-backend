  # Valence Bond Theory (VBT) and Hybridization

  ## Valence Bond Theory - Basic Concept

  **VBT states**: A covalent bond forms when half-filled atomic orbitals of two atoms overlap, sharing electrons.

  ### Types of Orbital Overlap

  **1. Sigma (σ) Bond**
  - Head-on/axial overlap
  - Electron density along the internuclear axis
  - Stronger bond (more overlap)
  - Free rotation possible

  **2. Pi (π) Bond**
  - Sideways/lateral overlap
  - Electron density above and below the internuclear axis
  - Weaker than sigma bond
  - No free rotation (restricts geometry)

  ### Bond Composition
  - **Single bond** = 1 σ bond
  - **Double bond** = 1 σ + 1 π bond
  - **Triple bond** = 1 σ + 2 π bonds

  ## Hybridization

  **Definition**: Mixing of atomic orbitals of similar energies to form new equivalent hybrid orbitals.

  ### Why Hybridization?

  Carbon has configuration: 1s² 2s² 2p²
  - Ground state: Only 2 unpaired electrons
  - But carbon forms 4 bonds (CH₄)!

  **Solution**: One 2s electron is promoted to 2p, then orbitals hybridize to form 4 equivalent sp³ orbitals.

  ## Types of Hybridization

  ### sp Hybridization (Linear)
  - **Orbitals involved**: 1s + 1p = 2 sp hybrid orbitals
  - **Geometry**: Linear
  - **Bond angle**: 180°
  - **Unhybridized orbitals**: 2p (for π bonds)

  **Examples**:
  - BeCl₂, BeH₂
  - CO₂ (C is sp)
  - C₂H₂ (acetylene)
  - HCN

  ### sp² Hybridization (Trigonal Planar)
  - **Orbitals involved**: 1s + 2p = 3 sp² hybrid orbitals
  - **Geometry**: Trigonal planar
  - **Bond angle**: 120°
  - **Unhybridized orbitals**: 1p (for π bond)

  **Examples**:
  - BF₃, BCl₃, AlCl₃
  - C₂H₄ (ethene)
  - Graphite (each C is sp²)
  - SO₃, NO₃⁻, CO₃²⁻

  ### sp³ Hybridization (Tetrahedral)
  - **Orbitals involved**: 1s + 3p = 4 sp³ hybrid orbitals
  - **Geometry**: Tetrahedral
  - **Bond angle**: 109.5°
  - **Unhybridized orbitals**: None

  **Examples**:
  - CH₄, CCl₄, SiH₄
  - NH₃ (1 LP in sp³ orbital)
  - H₂O (2 LPs in sp³ orbitals)
  - NH₄⁺, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, ClO₄⁻
  - Diamond (each C is sp³)

  ### sp³d Hybridization (Trigonal Bipyramidal)
  - **Orbitals involved**: 1s + 3p + 1d = 5 sp³d hybrid orbitals
  - **Geometry**: Trigonal bipyramidal
  - **Bond angles**: 90° (axial-equatorial), 120° (equatorial-equatorial)

  **Examples**:
  - PCl₅, PF₅, SbCl₅
  - SF₄ (1 LP → see-saw)
  - ClF₃ (2 LPs → T-shaped)
  - XeF₂ (3 LPs → linear)

  ### sp³d² Hybridization (Octahedral)
  - **Orbitals involved**: 1s + 3p + 2d = 6 sp³d² hybrid orbitals
  - **Geometry**: Octahedral
  - **Bond angle**: 90°

  **Examples**:
  - SF₆, SeF₆
  - [PtCl₆]²⁻, [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻
  - BrF₅ (1 LP → square pyramidal)
  - XeF₄ (2 LPs → square planar)

  ## Special Hybridization Types (for Coordination)

  ### dsp² Hybridization (Square Planar)
  - **Orbitals involved**: 1d + 1s + 2p
  - **Geometry**: Square planar
  - Used in d⁸ metal complexes

  **Examples**:
  - [Ni(CN)₄]²⁻
  - [PtCl₄]²⁻
  - [Pt(NH₃)₄]²⁺

  ### d²sp³ Hybridization (Octahedral - Inner)
  - Uses inner d-orbitals
  - Strong field ligands
  - Low spin complexes

  ### sp³d² Hybridization (Octahedral - Outer)
  - Uses outer d-orbitals
  - Weak field ligands
  - High spin complexes

  ## Determining Hybridization

  ### Method 1: Count electron domains (Steric Number)
  | Steric Number | Hybridization |
  |---------------|---------------|
  | 2 | sp |
  | 3 | sp² |
  | 4 | sp³ |
  | 5 | sp³d |
  | 6 | sp³d² |

  ### Method 2: Formula
  **Steric Number = ½[V + M - C + A]**

  Where:
  - V = Valence electrons of central atom
  - M = Number of monovalent atoms attached
  - C = Charge (positive)
  - A = Charge (negative)

  **Examples**:
  - CO₂: ½[4 + 0] = 2 → sp
  - NH₃: ½[5 + 3] = 4 → sp³
  - SO₄²⁻: ½[6 + 0 + 2] = 4 → sp³
  - PCl₅: ½[5 + 5] = 5 → sp³d

  ## Hybridization in Multiple Bonds

  ### Ethene (C₂H₄)
  - Each C: sp² hybridized
  - C-C: 1 σ (sp²-sp²) + 1 π (p-p)
  - C-H: σ (sp²-s)
  - Planar molecule

  ### Ethyne (C₂H₂)
  - Each C: sp hybridized
  - C-C: 1 σ (sp-sp) + 2 π (p-p)
  - C-H: σ (sp-s)
  - Linear molecule

  ### Benzene (C₆H₆)
  - Each C: sp² hybridized
  - Delocalized π electrons (6 p-orbitals)
  - Planar, aromatic

  ## Key Points for IIT JEE

  1. **Always identify σ and π bonds separately**
  2. **Hybridization = Steric Number (for main group)**
  3. **Lone pairs occupy hybrid orbitals**
  4. **π bonds use unhybridized p-orbitals**
  5. **Coordination compounds may use d-orbitals**
  6. **dsp² ≠ sp³ (different geometries!)**
