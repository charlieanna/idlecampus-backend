  energy? 🚀


  Staggered conformation has the lowest energy (most stable) because bonds are 60°
  apart, minimizing electron repulsion. Eclipsed has maximum repulsion (0° dihedral
  angle). Gauche and anti are specific to molecules like butane.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'
