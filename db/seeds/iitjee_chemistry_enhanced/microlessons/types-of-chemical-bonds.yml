  \    ## Ionic Bonding\n\n    **Definition**: Electrostatic attraction between oppositely\
  \ charged ions.\n\n    ### Formation\n    - Transfer of electrons from metal (low\
  \ IE) to non-metal (high EA)\n    - Example: Na + Cl → Na⁺Cl⁻\n\n    ### Properties\
  \ of Ionic Compounds\n    1. High melting and boiling points\n    2. Conduct electricity\
  \ in molten/aqueous state (not solid)\n    3. Soluble in polar solvents (water)\n\
  \    4. Hard but brittle\n    5. Form crystalline solids\n\n    ### Lattice Energy\n\
  \    - Energy released when gaseous ions form a solid lattice\n    - Higher lattice\
  \ energy = Stronger ionic bond\n    - Depends on charge and size of ions\n\n   \
  \ **Born-Haber Cycle**: Used to calculate lattice energy\n\n    ## Covalent Bonding\n\
  \n    **Definition**: Sharing of electron pairs between atoms.\n\n    ### Types\n\
  \    1. **Single bond** (σ bond): 1 shared pair (e.g., H-H)\n    2. **Double bond**\
  \ (σ + π): 2 shared pairs (e.g., O=O)\n    3. **Triple bond** (σ + 2π): 3 shared\
  \ pairs (e.g., N≡N)\n\n    ### Properties of Covalent Compounds\n    1. Low melting\
  \ and boiling points (except network solids)\n    2. Poor conductors of electricity\n\
  \    3. Soluble in non-polar solvents\n    4. Exist as gases, liquids, or soft solids\n\
  \n    ### Bond Parameters\n\n    #### 1. Bond Length\n    - Distance between nuclei\
  \ of bonded atoms\n    - Order: Triple < Double < Single bond\n    - Decreases with\
  \ increasing bond order\n\n    #### 2. Bond Energy\n    - Energy required to break\
  \ a bond\n    - Order: Triple > Double > Single bond\n    - Increases with bond\
  \ order\n\n    #### 3. Bond Angle\n    - Angle between two bonds at an atom\n  \
  \  - Determined by hybridization and geometry\n\n    ## Coordinate Bonding\n\n \
  \   **Definition**: Covalent bond where both electrons come from one atom (donor).\n\
  \n    ### Representation\n    - Shown as A → B (arrow from donor to acceptor)\n\
  \    - Example: H₃N → BF₃ (ammonia-borane complex)\n\n    ### Examples\n    1. **NH₄⁺**:\
  \ N donates lone pair to H⁺\n    2. **H₃O⁺**: O donates lone pair to H⁺\n    3.\
  \ **Metal complexes**: Ligands donate to metal\n\n    ## Fajans' Rules (Ionic/Covalent\
  \ Character)\n\n    Covalent character in ionic compounds increases when:\n    1.\
  \ Small cation (high polarizing power)\n    2. Large anion (high polarizability)\n\
  \    3. High charge on ions\n\n    **Example**: AgCl has more covalent character\
  \ than NaCl\n\n    ## Practice Problems\n\n    1. Why does LiCl have more covalent\
  \ character than NaCl?\n    2. Arrange in order of bond length: C-C, C=C, C≡C\n\
  \    3. Which has higher lattice energy: NaF or NaCl?\n\n## Key Points\n\n- Ionic\
  \ bonding\n\n- Covalent bonding\n\n- Coordinate bonds"
