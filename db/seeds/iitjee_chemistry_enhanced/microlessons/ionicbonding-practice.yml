  Ionic compounds are polar and dissolve in polar solvents (like water) due to ion-dipole
  interactions. They do NOT conduct in solid state (ions are fixed), have HIGH melting
  points, and exist as solids.


  ## Key Points


  - Re-read the question carefully.


  - Recall the relevant formula or rule.


  - Review the explanation once you answer.'
