  # Ionic Bonding - Practice

  ## Key Concepts

  ### Formation of Ionic Bonds
  - Transfer of electrons from metal to non-metal
  - Electrostatic attraction between cation and anion
  - Favored when ionization energy is low (metals) and electron affinity is high (non-metals)

  ### Lattice Energy
  **Definition**: Energy released when gaseous ions combine to form 1 mole of solid ionic compound.

  **Factors affecting lattice energy**:
  - Smaller ions → Higher lattice energy
  - Higher charges → Higher lattice energy

  **Formula**: U ∝ (q₁ × q₂) / (r₁ + r₂)

  ### Properties of Ionic Compounds
  - High melting and boiling points
  - Conduct electricity when molten or dissolved (not solid)
  - Soluble in polar solvents
  - Hard but brittle
  - Crystalline structure

    sequence_order: 1
    question: Which property is characteristic of ionic compounds?
    options:
      - Conduct electricity in solid state
      - Low melting points
      - Soluble in polar solvents
      - Exist as gases at room temperature
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: Ionic compounds dissolve in polar solvents (like water) due to ion-dipole interactions. They don't conduct in solid state (ions fixed), have HIGH melting points, and are solids.
    difficulty: easy

  - type: mcq
    slug: ionic-conductivity
    sequence_order: 2
    question: Ionic compounds conduct electricity when:
    options:
      - In solid state only
      - In molten state or dissolved in water
      - Only when heated above 1000°C
      - Never, they are insulators
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: In solid state, ions are fixed in lattice positions. When molten or dissolved, ions are free to move and conduct electricity.
    difficulty: easy

    slug: ionic-lattice-energy-factor
    sequence_order: 3
    question: Lattice energy increases with:
    options:
      - Larger ionic radii
      - Lower ionic charges
      - Smaller ionic radii and higher charges
      - Higher temperature
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: Lattice energy U ∝ q₁q₂/(r₁+r₂). Smaller ions get closer, higher charges attract more strongly. Both increase lattice energy.

    slug: ionic-lattice-energy-order
    sequence_order: 4
    question: Arrange in order of INCREASING lattice energy - NaCl, MgO, KCl, CaO
    options:
      - KCl < NaCl < MgO < CaO
      - KCl < NaCl < CaO < MgO
      - NaCl < KCl < CaO < MgO
      - MgO < CaO < NaCl < KCl
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: KCl (large ions, +1/-1) < NaCl (smaller, +1/-1) < CaO (larger than Mg, +2/-2) < MgO (smallest +2/-2 ions). Higher charge and smaller size increase lattice energy.

    slug: ionic-born-haber
    sequence_order: 5
    question: In the Born-Haber cycle for NaCl formation, which step releases energy?
    options:
      - Ionization of Na
      - Dissociation of Cl₂
      - Electron affinity of Cl
      - Sublimation of Na
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: Electron affinity is the energy released when Cl gains an electron to form Cl⁻. Ionization, dissociation, and sublimation all require energy input.

    slug: ionic-formation-condition
    sequence_order: 6
    question: Ionic bond formation is favored when:
    options:
      - Both elements have high ionization energy
      - Metal has low IE and non-metal has high EA
      - Both elements are non-metals
      - Elements have similar electronegativity
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Metal should easily lose electrons (low IE), non-metal should readily accept electrons (high EA). Large electronegativity difference favors ionic bonding.
    difficulty: easy

  - type: mcq
    slug: ionic-electronegativity-diff
    sequence_order: 7
    question: For a bond to be predominantly ionic, the electronegativity difference should be:
    options:
      - Less than 0.5
      - Between 0.5 and 1.7
      - Greater than 1.7
      - Exactly zero
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: Electronegativity difference > 1.7 indicates predominantly ionic character. Between 0.5-1.7 is polar covalent. Less than 0.5 is non-polar covalent.

    question: Which has the highest melting point?
    options:
      - NaCl
      - MgO
      - KBr
      - LiF
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: MgO has +2/-2 charges and small ion sizes, giving the highest lattice energy. Higher lattice energy = higher melting point. MgO melts at 2852°C vs NaCl at 801°C.

    slug: ionic-crystal-brittleness
    sequence_order: 9
    question: Why are ionic crystals brittle?
    options:
      - Weak bonds between ions
      - Displacement brings like charges adjacent, causing repulsion
      - They have low lattice energy
      - Ions are loosely packed
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: When force is applied, ionic layers shift. Like charges (+ facing + or - facing -) come adjacent, repel each other, and the crystal shatters.

    question: In NaCl crystal structure, each Na⁺ ion is surrounded by how many Cl⁻ ions?

    slug: ionic-solubility-rule
    sequence_order: 11
    question: Which statement about ionic compound solubility is correct?
    options:
      - All ionic compounds are soluble in water
      - Lattice energy alone determines solubility
      - Solubility depends on lattice energy vs hydration energy
      - Ionic compounds are always insoluble in organic solvents
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: Solubility requires hydration energy > lattice energy. If hydration releases more energy than needed to break lattice, the compound dissolves.

    options:
      - K⁺
      - Na⁺
      - Li⁺
      - Cs⁺
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: Smaller ions have higher charge density, attracting water molecules more strongly. Li⁺ is smallest, so highest hydration energy. Order - Li⁺ > Na⁺ > K⁺ > Cs⁺.

    slug: ionic-thermal-stability
    sequence_order: 13
    question: Among Group 2 carbonates (BeCO₃, MgCO₃, CaCO₃, BaCO₃), thermal stability:
    options:
      - Increases down the group
      - Decreases down the group
      - Remains constant
      - Is maximum for MgCO₃
    correct_answer_index: 0
    explanation: Smaller cations have higher polarizing power, distorting CO₃²⁻ more, making decomposition easier. Stability order - BaCO₃ > CaCO₃ > MgCO₃ > BeCO₃.

    options:
      - NaCl
      - MgCl₂
      - AlCl₃
      - KCl
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: Al³⁺ is small with +3 charge (high polarizing power). It distorts Cl⁻ electron cloud significantly, increasing covalent character. AlCl₃ is actually covalent (exists as dimer).
