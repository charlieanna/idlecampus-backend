  # Oxidation States - Practice

  ## Key Formula

  **Sum of oxidation states = Overall charge of complex**

  ## Common Ligand Charges

  | Ligand | Charge |
  |--------|--------|
  | NH₃, H₂O, CO, py | 0 (neutral) |
  | Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻, CN⁻, OH⁻, NO₂⁻ | -1 |
  | SO₄²⁻, CO₃²⁻, C₂O₄²⁻ (ox), S₂O₃²⁻ | -2 |
  | en, phen | 0 (neutral) |
  | EDTA⁴⁻ | -4 |
  | NO⁺ | +1 |

  ## Calculation Method

  1. Identify the overall charge of the complex
  2. Sum up all ligand charges
  3. Metal oxidation state = Overall charge - Ligand charges

    question: What is the oxidation state of Cr in [Cr(H₂O)₆]Cl₃?
    options:
      - +2
      - +3
      - +4
      - +6

    options:
      - +1
      - +2
      - +3
      - +4
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: 2 Cl⁻ outside means complex is [Co(NH₃)₅Cl]²⁺. But wait - 5 NH₃(0) + 1 Cl(-1) + Co = +2 is wrong. Actually complex = +2, so Co + 0 + (-1) = +2, Co = +3.
