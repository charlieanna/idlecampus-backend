  # Coordination Number - Practice

  ## Key Concept

  **Coordination Number (CN)** = Total number of **DONOR ATOMS** directly bonded to the central metal atom/ion.

  **Important**: CN counts donor atoms, NOT ligands!

  ## Common Coordination Numbers

  | CN | Geometry | Examples |
  |----|----------|----------|
  | 2 | Linear | [Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺, [CuCl₂]⁻ |
  | 4 | Tetrahedral or Square planar | [NiCl₄]²⁻, [Pt(NH₃)₄]²⁺ |
  | 6 | Octahedral | [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻, [Co(NH₃)₆]³⁺ |

  ## Calculating CN with Polydentate Ligands

  - **Monodentate** (1 donor atom): NH₃, H₂O, Cl⁻, CN⁻
  - **Bidentate** (2 donor atoms): en, ox, phen
  - **Hexadentate** (6 donor atoms): EDTA

  **Example**: [Co(en)₃]³⁺
  - 3 bidentate ligands × 2 donor atoms each = **CN = 6**
