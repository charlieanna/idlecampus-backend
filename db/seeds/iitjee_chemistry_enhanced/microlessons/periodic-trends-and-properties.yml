  # Periodic Trends and Properties

  Understanding periodic trends is ESSENTIAL for predicting chemical behavior. These trends form the foundation for all inorganic chemistry.

  ## 1. Atomic Radius

  **Definition**: Distance from the nucleus to the outermost electron shell.

  ### Trends:
  - **Across a period (→)**: DECREASES
    - Same number of shells, but more protons
    - Greater nuclear charge pulls electrons closer
    - Example: Li (152 pm) > Be (112 pm) > B (88 pm) > C (77 pm)

  - **Down a group (↓)**: INCREASES
    - More electron shells added
    - Shielding effect increases
    - Example: Li (152 pm) < Na (186 pm) < K (227 pm)

  ### Exceptions:
  - Noble gases have larger van der Waals radii (no covalent bonds)
  - d-block contraction: Elements after d-block are smaller than expected

  ## 2. Ionic Radius

  **Cations (positive ions)**: SMALLER than parent atom
  - Loss of electrons, remaining electrons pulled closer
  - Example: Na (186 pm) → Na⁺ (102 pm)

  **Anions (negative ions)**: LARGER than parent atom
  - Gain of electrons, increased electron-electron repulsion
  - Example: Cl (99 pm) → Cl⁻ (181 pm)

  ### Isoelectronic Species (Same number of electrons):
  Order by nuclear charge - more protons = smaller radius
  - O²⁻ > F⁻ > Ne > Na⁺ > Mg²⁺ > Al³⁺ (all have 10 electrons)

  ## 3. Ionization Energy (IE)

  **Definition**: Energy required to remove the outermost electron from a gaseous atom.

  M(g) → M⁺(g) + e⁻     ΔH = IE₁ (First Ionization Energy)

  ### Trends:
  - **Across a period (→)**: INCREASES
    - Smaller radius, electrons held more tightly
    - Example: Na (496 kJ/mol) < Mg (738) < Al (578) < Si (786) < P (1012) < S (1000) < Cl (1251)

  - **Down a group (↓)**: DECREASES
    - Larger radius, electrons farther from nucleus
    - Example: Li (520 kJ/mol) > Na (496) > K (419) > Rb (403)

  ### Important Exceptions:
  1. **Be > B**: B loses electron from 2p (easier than 2s)
  2. **N > O**: O has paired electrons in 2p (easier to remove one)
  3. **Mg > Al**: Al loses electron from 2p (easier than paired 2s)

  ### Successive Ionization Energies:
  IE₁ < IE₂ < IE₃ < IE₄ ...
  - Each successive electron is harder to remove
  - Large jump when removing from a noble gas configuration

  ## 4. Electron Affinity (EA)

  **Definition**: Energy change when an electron is added to a gaseous atom.

  X(g) + e⁻ → X⁻(g)     ΔH = EA

  ### Trends (generally):
  - **Across a period (→)**: Becomes more NEGATIVE (more exothermic)
  - **Down a group (↓)**: Becomes less NEGATIVE (less exothermic)

  ### Important Values:
  - **Chlorine has highest EA**: -349 kJ/mol
  - **Noble gases**: ~0 or positive (stable, don't want electrons)
  - **Group 2**: Very low EA (stable s² configuration)

  ### Exceptions:
  - F has lower EA than Cl (small size, electron repulsion)
  - O has lower EA than S (same reason)

  ## 5. Electronegativity

  **Definition**: Tendency of an atom to attract shared electrons in a bond.

  ### Pauling Scale (most common):
  - F = 4.0 (highest)
  - O = 3.5
  - N = 3.0
  - Cl = 3.0
  - C = 2.5

  ### Trends:
  - **Across a period (→)**: INCREASES
  - **Down a group (↓)**: DECREASES

  ### Applications:
  - **Bond polarity**: Difference in electronegativity determines polarity
  - **Ionic vs Covalent**: Large difference (>1.7) = ionic character

  ## 6. Metallic Character

  **Definition**: Tendency to lose electrons and form positive ions.

  ### Trends:
  - **Across a period (→)**: DECREASES
    - Elements become more non-metallic
  - **Down a group (↓)**: INCREASES
    - Easier to lose electrons

  ### Non-metallic Character: Opposite trends

  ## Summary Table

  | Property | Across Period (→) | Down Group (↓) |
  |----------|-------------------|----------------|
  | Atomic radius | Decreases | Increases |
  | Ionization energy | Increases | Decreases |
  | Electron affinity | More negative | Less negative |
  | Electronegativity | Increases | Decreases |
  | Metallic character | Decreases | Increases |

  ## Key Points for IIT JEE

  1. **IE exceptions**: Be > B, N > O, Mg > Al (memorize these!)
  2. **EA**: Cl > F (due to small size of F)
  3. **Isoelectronic**: Compare by nuclear charge
  4. **Diagonal relationships**: Li-Mg, Be-Al, B-Si have similar properties
  5. **d-block contraction**: Makes post-transition elements smaller

    sequence_order: 1
    question: Which element has the highest first ionization energy in Period 2?
    options:
      - Lithium (Li)
      - Carbon (C)
      - Nitrogen (N)
      - Neon (Ne)
    correct_answer_index: 3
    explanation: Neon has the highest IE in Period 2 because it has the smallest atomic radius and a completely filled stable electron configuration. IE generally increases across a period.
    difficulty: easy

    slug: ie-exception-be-b
    sequence_order: 2
    question: Why is the first ionization energy of Beryllium (Be) greater than Boron (B)?
    options:
      - Be has more protons than B
      - B loses an electron from 2p orbital which is higher in energy than 2s
      - Be has a smaller atomic radius
      - B has more electron-electron repulsion
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Boron's outermost electron is in the 2p orbital (higher energy, easier to remove) while Beryllium's is in the more stable 2s orbital. This makes Be's electron harder to remove, giving it higher IE.
    difficulty: medium

  - type: mcq
    slug: ie-exception-n-o
    sequence_order: 3
    question: The first ionization energy of Nitrogen is higher than Oxygen because:
    options:
      - Nitrogen has more protons
      - Nitrogen has a smaller atomic radius
      - Oxygen has a paired electron in 2p orbital that experiences repulsion
      - Oxygen has a lower electronegativity
    correct_answer_index: 2
    explanation: Oxygen has the configuration 2s²2p⁴ with one paired electron in 2p. The electron-electron repulsion in this paired orbital makes it easier to remove, lowering the IE compared to Nitrogen (2s²2p³ with all unpaired).

    slug: electron-affinity-cl-f
    sequence_order: 6
    question: Why does Chlorine have a more negative electron affinity than Fluorine?
    options:
      - Chlorine has more protons
      - Fluorine is too small, causing electron-electron repulsion
      - Chlorine has a higher electronegativity
      - Fluorine has a noble gas configuration
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Fluorine's very small size means the incoming electron experiences significant repulsion from existing electrons in the compact 2p orbital. Chlorine's larger size (3p orbital) provides more space, reducing repulsion.

  - type: mcq
    slug: cation-anion-size
    sequence_order: 11
    question: Which statement is CORRECT about ionic radii?
    options:
      - Cations are larger than their parent atoms
      - Anions are smaller than their parent atoms
      - Na⁺ is larger than Na
      - Cl⁻ is larger than Cl
    correct_answer_index: 3
    explanation: Anions gain electrons, increasing electron-electron repulsion and expanding the electron cloud. Cl (99 pm) → Cl⁻ (181 pm). Cations lose electrons and become smaller.
    difficulty: easy

  - type: mcq
    slug: second-ie
    sequence_order: 12
    question: Which element has the highest second ionization energy (IE₂)?
    options:
      - Sodium (Na)
      - Magnesium (Mg)
      - Aluminum (Al)
      - Silicon (Si)
    correct_answer_index: 0
    explanation: Na has configuration [Ne]3s¹. After losing one electron, Na⁺ = [Ne]. Removing a second electron means breaking into the stable noble gas core, requiring enormous energy.
    difficulty: hard

  - type: mcq
    slug: ea-group2
    sequence_order: 13
    question: Why do Group 2 elements (Be, Mg, Ca) have very low (almost zero) electron affinities?
    options:
      - They have very large atomic radii
      - They have stable fully-filled s-orbitals (ns²)
      - They have high ionization energies
      - They are metals
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Group 2 elements have stable ns² configuration. Adding an electron would go into a higher energy p-orbital, which is energetically unfavorable. Hence, their EA is nearly zero or positive.

  - type: mcq
    slug: effective-nuclear-charge
    sequence_order: 14
    question: Effective nuclear charge (Zeff) across a period:
    options:
      - Decreases due to shielding
      - Increases due to poor shielding by same-shell electrons
      - Remains constant
      - First increases then decreases
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Across a period, electrons are added to the same shell while protons increase. Electrons in the same shell shield each other poorly, so Zeff increases. This explains why atomic radius decreases across a period.
    difficulty: medium

  - type: mcq
    slug: d-block-contraction
    sequence_order: 15
    question: Due to d-block contraction, which pair has similar atomic radii?
    options:
      - Ca and Sc
      - Zr and Hf
      - Ti and Zr
      - Fe and Ru
    correct_answer_index: 1
    explanation: Lanthanoid contraction (similar to d-block contraction) causes Hf to have almost the same atomic radius as Zr, despite being one period below. The 4f electrons provide poor shielding.
