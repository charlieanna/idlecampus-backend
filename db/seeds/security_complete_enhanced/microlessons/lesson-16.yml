content_md: "# Microlesson \U0001F680\n\n# Networking Deep Dive\n\n    Master advanced\
  \ networking concepts including Ingress, Network Policies, and troubleshooting techniques.\n\
  \n    ## Ingress\n\n    HTTP/HTTPS routing to services:\n    - Single external endpoint\n\
  \    - Path-based routing\n    - Virtual hosting\n    - TLS/SSL termination\n\n\
  \    **Ingress Controllers:**\n    - NGINX Ingress Controller\n    - Traefik\n \
  \   - HAProxy\n    - Cloud-specific (ALB, GCE)\n\n    **Example Ingress:**\n   \
  \ ```yaml\n    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\n    kind: Ingress\n    metadata:\n\
  \      name: my-ingress\n    spec:\n      rules:\n      - host: app.example.com\n\
  \        http:\n          paths:\n          - path: /api\n            pathType:\
  \ Prefix\n            backend:\n              service:\n                name: api-service\n\
  \                port:\n                  number: 80\n    ```\n\n    ## Network\
  \ Policies\n\n    Control traffic between pods:\n\n    **Default Behavior:** All\
  \ pods can communicate\n\n    **With NetworkPolicy:**\n    - Deny all, allow specific\n\
  \    - Label-based selection\n    - Namespace isolation\n    - Ingress and egress\
  \ rules\n\n    **Example Policy:**\n    ```yaml\n    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\n\
  \    kind: NetworkPolicy\n    metadata:\n      name: allow-frontend\n    spec:\n\
  \      podSelector:\n        matchLabels:\n          role: backend\n      ingress:\n\
  \      - from:\n        - podSelector:\n            matchLabels:\n             \
  \ role: frontend\n        ports:\n        - protocol: TCP\n          port: 8080\n\
  \    ```\n\n    ## Network Troubleshooting\n\n    **Common Issues:**\n    - Service\
  \ not accessible\n    - DNS resolution failures\n    - Network policy blocking traffic\n\
  \    - Ingress misconfiguration\n\n    **Debugging Tools:**\n    ```bash\n    #\
  \ Test service connectivity\n    kubectl run debug --image=nicolaka/netshoot -it\
  \ --rm -- bash\n\n    # DNS lookup\n    nslookup my-service\n\n    # Check endpoints\n\
  \    kubectl get endpoints\n\n    # Test port connectivity\n    nc -zv my-service\
  \ 80\n    ```\n\n    ## Service Mesh (Introduction)\n\n    Advanced traffic management:\n\
  \    - Istio, Linkerd, Consul\n    - Traffic splitting\n    - Circuit breaking\n\
  \    - Observability\n\n    Practice networking in the hands-on labs!"

  question: What is the main focus of this lesson on Lesson 16?
  options:
  - Understanding core concepts and practical applications related to Lesson 16
  - Only theoretical knowledge without application
  - Memorizing definitions without context
  - Learning unrelated peripheral topics
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: This lesson on Lesson 16 aims to build both conceptual understanding
    and practical knowledge. Effective learning combines theory with application,
    allowing you to not only understand concepts but also apply them in real-world
    contexts. This integrated approach is more valuable than rote memorization or
    purely theoretical study.
objectives:
- Apply least privilege
- Design policies
- Harden auth & keys
