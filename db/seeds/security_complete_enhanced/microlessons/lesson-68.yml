content_md: "# Microlesson \U0001F680\n\n# Kubernetes Architecture Overview\n\n  \
  \  ## Control Plane Components\n\n    ### API Server (kube-apiserver)\n    - Central\
  \ management entity\n    - Exposes Kubernetes API\n    - Frontend for the control\
  \ plane\n    - All operations go through the API server\n\n    ### etcd\n    - Consistent\
  \ and highly-available key-value store\n    - Stores all cluster data\n    - Source\
  \ of truth for cluster state\n\n    ### Scheduler (kube-scheduler)\n    - Watches\
  \ for newly created Pods\n    - Selects nodes for pods to run on\n    - Considers\
  \ resource requirements, constraints, and affinity\n\n    ### Controller Manager\
  \ (kube-controller-manager)\n    - Runs controller processes\n    - Node Controller:\
  \ Monitors node status\n    - Replication Controller: Maintains correct number of\
  \ pods\n    - Endpoints Controller: Populates endpoints objects\n    - Service Account\
  \ Controller: Creates default accounts\n\n    ## Node Components\n\n    ### kubelet\n\
  \    - Runs on each node\n    - Ensures containers are running in a Pod\n    - Communicates\
  \ with API server\n    - Manages pod lifecycle\n\n    ### kube-proxy\n    - Network\
  \ proxy on each node\n    - Implements Kubernetes Service concept\n    - Maintains\
  \ network rules\n    - Enables pod-to-pod communication\n\n    ### Container Runtime\n\
  \    - Software responsible for running containers\n    - Examples: Docker, containerd,\
  \ CRI-O\n\n    ## Add-ons\n\n    - **DNS**: Cluster DNS server (CoreDNS)\n    -\
  \ **Dashboard**: Web-based UI\n    - **Ingress Controller**: HTTP/HTTPS routing\n\
  \    - **Metrics Server**: Resource usage monitoring\n\n    ## Communication Flow\n\
  \n    1. kubectl sends request to API server\n    2. API server validates and stores\
  \ in etcd\n    3. Controllers watch for changes\n    4. Scheduler assigns pods to\
  \ nodes\n    5. kubelet pulls images and starts containers\n    6. kube-proxy configures\

  question: What is the main focus of this lesson on Lesson 68?
  options:
  - Understanding core concepts and practical applications related to Lesson 68
  - Only theoretical knowledge without application
  - Memorizing definitions without context
  - Learning unrelated peripheral topics
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: This lesson on Lesson 68 aims to build both conceptual understanding
    and practical knowledge. Effective learning combines theory with application,
    allowing you to not only understand concepts but also apply them in real-world
    contexts. This integrated approach is more valuable than rote memorization or
    purely theoretical study.
objectives:
- Apply least privilege
- Design policies
- Harden auth & keys
