  \ TLS (Transport Layer Security) encrypts data in transit between clients and servers.\n\
  \n    ## What is TLS?\n\n    **TLS** (formerly SSL) provides:\n    - **Encryption**:\
  \ Data is encrypted in transit\n    - **Authentication**: Verify server identity\n\
  \    - **Integrity**: Detect tampering\n\n    ## TLS Handshake Process\n\n    ```\n\
  \    Client                                    Server\n      |                 \
  \                        |\n      |--- ClientHello (supported ciphers) ---->|\n\
  \      |                                         |\n      |<--- ServerHello (chosen\
  \ cipher) --------|\n      |<--- Certificate (server's cert) --------|\n      |<---\
  \ ServerHelloDone -------------------|\n      |                                \
  \         |\n      |--- ClientKeyExchange ----------------->|\n      |--- ChangeCipherSpec\
  \ ------------------>|\n      |--- Finished -------------------------->|\n     \
  \ |                                         |\n      |<--- ChangeCipherSpec ------------------|\n\
  \      |<--- Finished --------------------------|\n      |                     \
  \                    |\n      |<========== Encrypted Data ===========>|\n    ```\n\
  \n    ### Steps Explained:\n\n    1. **ClientHello**: Client sends supported TLS\
  \ versions and cipher suites\n    2. **ServerHello**: Server chooses TLS version\
  \ and cipher\n    3. **Certificate**: Server sends its certificate (public key)\n\
  \    4. **Certificate Verification**: Client validates certificate\n    5. **Key\
  \ Exchange**: Generate shared session key\n    6. **Finished**: Both confirm encryption\
  \ is working\n    7. **Encrypted Communication**: All data now encrypted\n\n   \
  \ ## Certificates\n\n    ### Certificate Components\n\n    - **Subject**: Who the\
  \ certificate is issued to (domain name)\n    - **Issuer**: Who signed the certificate\
  \ (CA)\n    - **Public Key**: Server's public key\n    - **Validity Period**: Start\
  \ and end dates\n    - **Signature**: CA's digital signature\n\n    ### Certificate\
  \ Types\n\n    1. **Self-Signed**: You sign your own certificate\n       - ⚠️ Browsers\
  \ will show warnings\n       - ✅ Good for testing/development\n       - ✅ Good for\
  \ internal services\n\n    2. **Certificate Authority (CA) Signed**: Trusted third\
  \ party\n       - ✅ Browsers trust automatically\n       - ✅ Required for public\
  \ websites\n       - Examples: Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, Comodo\n\n    3. **Wildcard**:\
  \ Covers all subdomains\n       - `*.example.com` covers `api.example.com`, `www.example.com`\n\
  \n    ## TLS Versions\n\n    - **TLS 1.3**: Current, fastest, most secure ✅\n  \
  \  - **TLS 1.2**: Still widely used, secure ✅\n    - **TLS 1.1**: Deprecated ⚠️\n\
  \    - **TLS 1.0**: Deprecated ⚠️\n    - **SSL 3.0**: Broken, do not use ❌\n   \
  \ - **SSL 2.0**: Broken, do not use ❌\n\n    ## Common Ports\n\n    | Protocol |\
  \ Port | Description |\n    |----------|------|-------------|\n    | HTTP | 80 |\
  \ Unencrypted web traffic |\n    | HTTPS | 443 | Encrypted web traffic (TLS) |\n\
  \    | SMTP (TLS) | 587 | Encrypted email submission |\n    | IMAP (TLS) | 993 |\
  \ Encrypted email retrieval |\n\n    ## Certificate Authorities (CAs)\n\n    ###\
  \ Root CA\n    Browsers and operating systems trust a set of root CAs.\n\n    ###\
  \ Chain of Trust\n    ```\n    Root CA (trusted by browser)\n      └── Intermediate\
  \ CA\n            └── Your Certificate\n    ```\n\n    ### Let's Encrypt\n    Free,\
  \ automated certificate authority.\n\n    ```bash\n    # Install certbot\n    sudo\
  \ apt install certbot\n\n    # Get certificate for domain\n    sudo certbot certonly\
  \ --standalone -d example.com\n    ```\n\n    ## Certificate Pinning\n\n    **Hard-code**\
  \ expected certificate or public key in application.\n    - Extra security against\
  \ compromised CAs\n    - Used in mobile apps, critical services\n    - ⚠️ Requires\
  \ careful key rotation"

  question: What three security guarantees does TLS/SSL provide?
  options:
  - Encryption (confidentiality), authentication (identity verification), and integrity
    (tampering detection)
  - Speed, reliability, and backwards compatibility
  - Compression, caching, and load balancing
  - Port forwarding, proxying, and tunneling
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: TLS/SSL provides three critical security guarantees - Encryption ensures
    data cannot be read by eavesdroppers during transit, Authentication verifies you're
    communicating with the legitimate server (via certificates), and Integrity detects
    if data has been tampered with. Together, these protect against man-in-the-middle
    attacks, eavesdropping, and data modification. This is why HTTPS (HTTP over TLS)
    is essential for all web traffic.
objectives:
- Explain PKI/TLS
- Harden HTTPS
- Rotate/renew certs
