  \n    Cryptography is the foundation of modern security, protecting data in transit\
  \ and at rest.\n\n    ## Core Concepts\n\n    ### Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability\
  \ (CIA Triad)\n    - **Confidentiality**: Only authorized parties can access data\n\
  \    - **Integrity**: Data hasn't been tampered with\n    - **Availability**: Systems\
  \ and data are accessible when needed\n\n    ### Types of Cryptography\n\n    ##\
  \ 1. Symmetric Encryption\n    Same key for encryption and decryption.\n\n    **Pros:**\n\
  \    - Fast and efficient\n    - Good for large amounts of data\n\n    **Cons:**\n\
  \    - Key distribution problem\n    - Need secure channel to share key\n\n    **Common\
  \ Algorithms:**\n    - **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: Industry standard,\
  \ very secure\n    - **ChaCha20**: Fast, used in TLS\n    - **3DES**: Legacy, being\
  \ phased out\n\n    ```bash\n    # Encrypt file with AES-256\n    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc\
  \ -salt -in file.txt -out file.txt.enc\n\n    # Decrypt file\n    openssl enc -d\
  \ -aes-256-cbc -in file.txt.enc -out file.txt\n    ```\n\n    ## 2. Asymmetric Encryption\
  \ (Public Key Cryptography)\n    Uses key pairs: public key (encrypt) and private\
  \ key (decrypt).\n\n    **Pros:**\n    - Solves key distribution problem\n    -\
  \ Enables digital signatures\n\n    **Cons:**\n    - Slower than symmetric encryption\n\
  \    - More computationally expensive\n\n    **Common Algorithms:**\n    - **RSA**:\
  \ Widely used, 2048-bit or 4096-bit\n    - **ECDSA**: Elliptic Curve, smaller keys,\
  \ faster\n    - **Ed25519**: Modern, fast, secure\n\n    ## 3. Hashing (One-Way\
  \ Functions)\n    Creates fixed-size fingerprint of data. Cannot be reversed.\n\n\
  \    **Use Cases:**\n    - Password storage\n    - Data integrity verification\n\
  \    - Digital signatures\n\n    **Common Algorithms:**\n    - **SHA-256**: 256-bit\
  \ hash, very secure\n    - **SHA-512**: 512-bit hash, even more secure\n    - **bcrypt**:\
  \ Designed for passwords, includes salt\n    - **MD5**: **BROKEN - DO NOT USE**\n\
  \n    ```bash\n    # Generate SHA-256 hash\n    echo \"Hello World\" | sha256sum\n\
  \n    # Verify file integrity\n    sha256sum file.txt > file.txt.sha256\n    sha256sum\
  \ -c file.txt.sha256\n    ```\n\n    ## Practical Applications\n\n    ### Passwords\n\
  \    **Never store passwords in plain text!**\n\n    ```bash\n    # Bad: Storing\
  \ password directly\n    PASSWORD=\"secret123\"\n\n    # Good: Store hashed password\
  \ with salt\n    # System does this automatically with bcrypt/scrypt\n    ```\n\n\
  \    ### Data at Rest\n    Encrypt sensitive files, databases, disk volumes.\n\n\
  \    ### Data in Transit\n    Use TLS/SSL to encrypt network communication.\n\n\
  ## Key Points\n\n- Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption\n\n- Hashing and integrity\n\
  \n- AES, RSA, SHA-256"

  question: What is the main difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
  options:
  - Symmetric uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric uses
    a public/private key pair
  - Symmetric is slower than asymmetric encryption
  - Symmetric can only encrypt small amounts of data
  - Symmetric cannot be used for secure communication
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: 'The fundamental difference is in key usage. Symmetric encryption (like
    AES) uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption, making it fast
    but requiring secure key distribution. Asymmetric encryption (like RSA) uses a
    public key for encryption and a private key for decryption, solving the key distribution
    problem but being slower. In practice, they are often combined: asymmetric encryption
    securely exchanges a symmetric key, which then encrypts the actual data.'
objectives:
- Define the control
- Choose tooling
- Integrate checks in CI/CD
