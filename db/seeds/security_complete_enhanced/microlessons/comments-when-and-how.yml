  \   \"Don't comment bad code—rewrite it.\" — Brian W. Kernighan & P. J. Plaugher\n\
  \n    ## The Proper Use of Comments\n\n    **The best comment is the one you found\
  \ a way not to write.**\n\n    Comments are, at best, a necessary evil. Every comment\
  \ represents a failure to express yourself in code.\n\n    ### Why Comments Are\
  \ Often Bad\n\n    1. **They lie** - Code changes, comments often don't\n    2.\
  \ **They're maintained** - Extra work that's often neglected\n    3. **They clutter**\
  \ - Make code harder to read\n    4. **They mislead** - Outdated comments are worse\
  \ than no comments\n\n    ## Good Comments\n\n    ### 1. Legal Comments\n    ```python\n\
  \    # Copyright (C) 2024 Company Name\n    # Licensed under the Apache License,\
  \ Version 2.0\n    ```\n\n    ### 2. Informative Comments\n    ```python\n    #\
  \ Returns an instance of the Responder being tested\n    def responder_instance():\n\
  \        return Responder()\n\n    # format matched: kk:mm:ss EEE, MMM dd, yyyy\n\
  \    pattern = r'\\\\d{2}:\\\\d{2}:\\\\d{2} \\\\w{3}, \\\\w{3} \\\\d{2}, \\\\d{4}'\n\
  \    ```\n\n    **Better:** Use function names instead:\n    ```python\n    def\
  \ responder_being_tested():\n        return Responder()\n\n    TIMESTAMP_FORMAT_PATTERN\
  \ = r'\\\\d{2}:\\\\d{2}:\\\\d{2} \\\\w{3}, \\\\w{3} \\\\d{2}, \\\\d{4}'\n    ```\n\
  \n    ### 3. Explanation of Intent\n    ```python\n    def compare_to(other):\n\
  \        if self < other:\n            return -1\n        elif self > other:\n \
  \           return 1\n        else:\n            # We want to force objects of this\
  \ type to the bottom of the list\n            return 0\n    ```\n\n    ### 4. Clarification\n\
  \    ```python\n    assertTrue(a.compareTo(a) == 0)    # a == a\n    assertTrue(a.compareTo(b)\
  \ != 0)    # a != b\n    assertTrue(ab.compareTo(ab) == 0)  # ab == ab\n    assertTrue(a.compareTo(b)\
  \ == -1)   # a < b\n    ```\n\n    ### 5. Warning of Consequences\n    ```python\n\
  \    # Don't run unless you have 8+ hours to spare\n    def test_with_really_big_file():\n\
  \        write_lines_to_file(10000000)\n        response = serve_file()\n      \
  \  # ...\n\n    # SimpleDateFormat is not thread safe\n    # so we need to create\
  \ a new instance each time\n    date_format = SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd\")\n\
  \    ```\n\n    ### 6. TODO Comments\n    ```python\n    # TODO: These are not needed\n\
  \    # We expect this to go away when we do the checkout model\n    def make_version():\n\
  \        return None\n    ```\n\n    **Important:** Scan and eliminate TODOs regularly!\n\
  \n    ### 7. Amplification\n    ```python\n    # the trim is really important. It\
  \ removes the starting spaces\n    # that could cause the item to be recognized\
  \ as another list\n    list_item_content = match.group(3).strip()\n    ```\n\n \
  \   ### 8. Public API Documentation\n    ```python\n    def calculate_compound_interest(principal,\
  \ rate, time):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate compound interest.\n\n       \
  \ Args:\n            principal (float): Initial amount\n            rate (float):\
  \ Interest rate (as decimal, e.g., 0.05 for 5%)\n            time (int): Time period\
  \ in years\n\n        Returns:\n            float: Final amount after compound interest\n\
  \n        Example:\n            >>> calculate_compound_interest(1000, 0.05, 2)\n\
  \            1102.50\n        \"\"\"\n        return principal * (1 + rate) ** time\n\
  \    ```\n\n    ## Bad Comments\n\n    ### 1. Mumbling\n    ```python\n    def load_properties():\n\
  \        try:\n            properties_path = \"properties.xml\"\n            # Load\
  \ properties here\n            load(properties_path)\n        except Exception:\n\
  \            # No properties files means all defaults are loaded\n            pass\n\
  \    ```\n\n    **Problems:**\n    - Who loads the defaults?\n    - When are they\
  \ loaded?\n    - Were they already loaded before the exception?\n\n    ### 2. Redundant\
  \ Comments\n    ```python\n    # Utility method that returns when this.closed is\
  \ true.\n    # Throws an exception if the timeout is reached.\n    def wait_for_close(timeout_millis):\n\
  \        if not self.closed:\n            wait(timeout_millis)\n            if not\
  \ self.closed:\n                raise Exception(\"MockResponseSender could not be\
  \ closed\")\n    ```\n\n    The comment provides no more information than the code\
  \ itself!\n\n    ### 3. Misleading Comments\n    ```python\n    # Returns days between\
  \ two dates (inclusive)\n    def days_between(start, end):\n        # Actually doesn't\
  \ include the end date!\n        return (end - start).days\n    ```\n\n    ### 4.\
  \ Mandated Comments\n    ```python\n    # ❌ Don't do this for every function\n \
  \   def __init__(self, name):\n        \"\"\"\n        Constructor for Employee.\n\
  \n        Args:\n            name: The name\n        \"\"\"\n        self.name =\
  \ name\n    ```\n\n    ### 5. Journal Comments\n    ```python\n    # Changes (from\
  \ 11-Oct-2001)\n    # ---------------------------\n    # 11-Oct-2001 : Re-organized\
  \ the class (DG);\n    # 05-Nov-2001 : Added getDescription() method (DG);\n   \
  \ # 25-Jun-2002 : Removed unnecessary import (DG);\n    ```\n\n    **Use version\
  \ control instead!**\n\n    ### 6. Noise Comments\n    ```python\n    # Default\
  \ constructor\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    # Returns the day\n\
  \    def get_day(self):\n        return self.day\n\n    # Sets the day\n    def\
  \ set_day(self, day):\n        self.day = day\n    ```\n\n    These add zero value!\n\
  \n    ### 7. Position Markers\n    ```python\n    # //////////////// Actions //////////////////\n\
  \    def action1():\n        pass\n\n    def action2():\n        pass\n    ```\n\
  \n    Use sparingly, if at all.\n\n    ### 8. Closing Brace Comments\n    ```python\n\
  \    def process_data():\n        if condition:\n            while True:\n     \
  \           try:\n                    # lots of code\n                except Exception:\n\
  \                    pass\n                # end try\n            # end while\n\
  \        # end if\n    # end function\n    ```\n\n    **Solution:** Make functions\
  \ shorter!\n\n    ### 9. Commented-Out Code\n    ```python\n    # inputRecord =\
  \ self.input_stream.read()\n    response = Response()\n    # response.set_status(200)\n\
  \    response.set_body(formatter.format(body))\n    # old_response = response\n\
  \    ```\n\n    **NEVER DO THIS!**\n    - Others won't delete it (afraid it's important)\n\
  \    - It piles up over time\n    - Use version control to preserve history\n\n\
  \    ### 10. HTML in Comments\n    ```python\n    \"\"\"\n    Load properties from\
  \ a file.\n    <p>\n    This method reads a properties file and loads all\n    key-value\
  \ pairs into memory.\n    <ul>\n    <li>Supports .properties files</li>\n    <li>Supports\
  \ .xml files</li>\n    </ul>\n    </p>\n    \"\"\"\n    ```\n\n    HTML is unreadable\
  \ in source code!\n\n    ### 11. Too Much Information\n    ```python\n    # RFC\
  \ 2045 - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)\n    # Part One: Format of\
  \ Internet Message Bodies\n    # Section 6.8. Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding\n\
  \    # The encoding process represents 24-bit groups of input bits\n    # as output\
  \ strings of 4 encoded characters. Proceeding from\n    # left to right... (continues\
  \ for 30 more lines)\n    def encode_base64(data):\n        pass\n    ```\n\n  \
  \  Link to RFC instead!\n\n    ## Comment Best Practices\n\n    ### When to Comment\n\
  \n    **DO comment when:**\n    - Explaining complex algorithms\n    - Documenting\
  \ public APIs\n    - Warning about consequences\n    - Legal requirements\n    -\
  \ TODO notes (temporarily)\n\n    **DON'T comment when:**\n    - Code is self-explanatory\n\
  \    - You can use better names instead\n    - Function/variable name would suffice\n\
  \    - It restates what code does\n\n    ### Before Writing a Comment\n\n    Ask\
  \ yourself:\n    1. Can I express this in code instead?\n    2. Can I use a better\
  \ function/variable name?\n    3. Can I extract a method with a descriptive name?\n\
  \    4. Is this comment worth maintaining?\n\n    ### Example: Comment to Code Transformation\n\
  \n    #### ❌ With Comments\n    ```python\n    def get_employees():\n        # Check\
  \ to see if the employee is eligible for full benefits\n        if employee.flags\
  \ & HOURLY_FLAG and employee.age > 65:\n            # Complex logic here\n     \
  \       pass\n    ```\n\n    #### ✅ Without Comments\n    ```python\n    def get_employees():\n\
  \        if is_eligible_for_full_benefits(employee):\n            # Complex logic\
  \ here\n            pass\n\n    def is_eligible_for_full_benefits(employee):\n \
  \       return employee.flags & HOURLY_FLAG and employee.age > 65\n    ```\n\n \
  \   ## Documentation vs Comments\n\n    ### Documentation (Good)\n    - Public API\
  \ reference\n    - Architecture decisions\n    - Setup instructions\n    - Usage\
  \ examples\n    - Design patterns used\n\n    ### Comments in Code (Use Sparingly)\n\
  \    - Why, not what\n    - Non-obvious consequences\n    - Temporary notes (TODO)\n\
  \n    ## Key Takeaways\n\n    1. **Comments are a failure** - Represent inability\
  \ to express in code\n    2. **Code changes, comments rot** - Outdated comments\
  \ mislead\n    3. **Explain yourself in code** - Better names > comments\n    4.\
  \ **Good comments are rare** - Legal, warning, TODO, public API docs\n    5. **Bad\
  \ comments are common** - Mumbling, noise, redundant, misleading\n    6. **Delete\
  \ commented-out code** - Version control preserves history\n    7. **Before commenting,\
  \ try:**\n       - Better names\n       - Extract method\n       - Simplify code\n\
  \    8. **Document the \"why\", not the \"what\"**\n\n    Remember: **The best comment\
  \ is a well-named function or variable!**"

  question: According to clean code principles, what should you do before writing
    a comment?
  options:
  - Try to express the intent through better function names, variable names, or extracted
    methods
  - Write the comment first to document your thinking
  - Add HTML formatting to make it readable
  - Create a journal entry with the date
  correct_answer_index: 0
  explanation: Before writing a comment, you should always try to express your intent
    in code through better naming or code structure. The best comment is the one you
    found a way not to write. Use descriptive function and variable names, extract
    methods with clear names, and simplify code logic. Only add comments when the
    code truly cannot express the intent clearly, such as explaining complex algorithms,
    warning of consequences, or documenting public APIs.
