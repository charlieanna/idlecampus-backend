KEY FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. REFLECTION & CHECKPOINT COVERAGE:
   - Nearly all courses have excellent reflection and checkpoint coverage
   - Docker: 100% coverage (7/7 microlessons)
   - Kubernetes: 100% coverage (11/11 microlessons)
   - Linux: 100% coverage (11/11 microlessons)
   - Networking: 97% coverage (98/101 microlessons)
   - Security: 100% coverage (87/87 microlessons)
   - IIT-JEE Chemistry: 100% coverage (274/274 microlessons)
   - Python: 46% coverage (13/28 microlessons) - NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

2. COMMAND-BASED COURSES - PRACTICE INSUFFICIENCY:
   ALL command-based courses currently fall short of the target:
   
   Docker:
     - Current: 1 terminal + 1 MCQ per microlesson
     - Needs: +2 more terminal exercises per microlesson
     - Needs: +1 more MCQ per microlesson
   
   Kubernetes:
     - Current: 1 terminal + 1 MCQ per microlesson
     - Needs: +2 more terminal exercises per microlesson
     - Needs: +1 more MCQ per microlesson
   
   Linux:
     - Current: 1 terminal + 2.27 MCQ per microlesson
     - Needs: +2 more terminal exercises per microlesson
     - Already meets MCQ target ✓
   
   Networking:
     - Current: 0.23 terminal + 1.24 MCQ per microlesson
     - Needs: +2.77 more terminal exercises per microlesson
     - Needs: +0.76 more MCQ per microlesson
     - Most significant gap among command-based courses

3. PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS:
   
   HIGH PRIORITY:
   a) Python Course: Add reflection and checkpoint exercises to remaining 15 microlessons
   b) Networking Course: Add more terminal exercises (currently very low at 0.23 per ML)
   
   MEDIUM PRIORITY:
   c) Docker & Kubernetes: Double the terminal exercises (from 1 to 3+ per microlesson)
   d) Linux: Double the terminal exercises (from 1 to 3+ per microlesson)
   
   LOW PRIORITY:
   e) Add 1 additional MCQ to Docker, Kubernetes, and Networking courses

4. STRENGTHS:
   - Excellent exercise diversity across courses (terminal, MCQ, reflection, checkpoint, sandbox, etc.)
   - IIT-JEE Chemistry has exceptional content depth with 274 microlessons
   - Security course has good balance with sandbox exercises (7 total)
   - Strong reflection and checkpoint coverage for metacognition and assessment
